GDE: There is no GDE section in plan. Appendix 2E, which is not referenced in the plan, give an overview of the GDE assessemnt, but does not have the figures it claims to have. No groundwater data used in assessment; no clear map; overall poor GDE assessment 
SMC: They have done a decent job explaining different indicators clearly, they have data gaps for ISW and WQ which they have acknowledged it.
CLIMATE CHANGE: Used numerical model to account for precip, ET, and streamflow into 2030 and 2070 Central Tendency scenarios. Projected SY given as a range based on different climate scenarios.
PMA: This is the most detailed PMA I have seen so far.
OTHER: No mention of Open ET, water markets, or widespread requirements for well meters. PMAs addressed supply augmentation and demand reduction with planned projects.
Stakeholder: No federally recognized tribes are present in the Basin, there is no DAC map provided (mentioned that an appendix related to DACs will be released in the final draft), the density map providided is not specific to domestic wells instead a point map is used to map all wlls in one single map without distinguishing between the different types of wells.

The GSAs carried out community engagement during the development of the GSP, which included public meetings and materials shared to inform the public and then revised to incorporate public feedback. This plan aims to build on that foundation to now engage the community, interested parties, stakeholders, organizations, and agencies as the GSA Boards consider adopting the GSP and inaugurating GSP implementation. The draft GSP chapters on information, monitoring networks, sustainable management criteria, and projects and management actions were shared for public review in July of 2021. The GSA managers and Butte Advisory Board will complete a final review of the GSP before releasing the draft for a 60‐day public review period in September of 2021. The GSAs will hold formal public hearings and consider adopting by December of 2021 for a January 2022 submittal.

Public Meetings/Hearing Public meetings or hearings are formal opportunities for people to provide official comments on programs, plans and proposals. Regular meetings of the GSAs and the Butte Subbasin Advisory Board constitute regular public meetings that will be noticed and conducted in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act. SGMA requires that a public meeting be held prior to the adoption of a fee and that public hearings are held for the adoption of GSP elements and the final GSP plan. There are also constitutional requirements for public hearings for some fee/rate options. Public meetings and hearings are an important forum for people to share viewpoints and concerns, but often occur at the end of a process, when only one option is under consideration. The GSAs will hold required public meetings and hearings, but will also use less formal public workshops to solicit feedback and information throughout the process. 

Public Workshops The Butte Subbasin Advisory Board will convene public workshops. These workshops provide less formal opportunities for people to learn about groundwater, SGMA, and GSP elements. Workshops can be organized in a variety of ways, including webinars, open houses, “stations” where people can ask questions one‐on‐one, and traditional presentations with facilitated question and answer sessions. In order to solicit feedback from people who may not be comfortable speaking in public, workshops can include small group breakout discussions, comment cards and other techniques. Whatever format is used, workshops will be designed to maximize opportunities for public input. 

Public Notices Public notices, often required by law, aim to notify agencies and the public about activities that may affect the public. As outlined in this Communications and Engagement Plan, the GSA will sponsor a variety of opportunities for people to participate in the development and implementation of the GSP, including workshops, public hearings, providing comments at Board and Butte Subbasin Advisory Board meetings and through written comments.

The Butte Subbasin lacks organized DAC organizations and therefore made it difficult to identify and engage these communities.    The BAB sought out potential DAC representatives through discussions with area leaders and encouraged participation. However, during the plan development time period of January 2020 through 2021 opportunities to be publicly engaged were severely limited due to on‐going COVID‐19 restrictions.  ","ES-2

Assessment of groundwater quality in the Butte Subbasin focuses on annual observation of salinity (which will be observed through monitoring of electrical conductivity or EC), temperature, and pH in the principal aquifers. Each of these parameters is influenced by ambient conditions and the parent material of the principal aquifers. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and pH are also influenced by human activity. While only salinity will be used to monitor attainment of MOs and avoidance of breaches in MTs, changes in pH and temperature may indicate shifting groundwater conditions and trigger additional investigation. The groundwater quality monitoring network implemented for representative monitoring under SGMA will build upon existing programs in place. Additional monitoring will continue to be conducted by DWR and other agencies to track constituents not managed under this GSP, including a variety of minerals, metals, pesticides and herbicides. Data from ongoing monitoring by various state and federal agencies will be available to the GSAs to augment local datasets and understanding of water quality in the Butte Subbasin and can be found on the State Board’s Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment (GAMA) program at https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/.
Nine sites are included in the groundwater quality monitoring network based on use in existing monitoring programs, the existing period of record, the quality of data reported and subject to permission of the well owner to monitor the well. Water quality monitoring in the Butte Subbasin has historically been conducted by Butte and Glenn Counties during the summer.

 ISW map and ISWs were delineated using multiple water year types AND description of temporal variability= yes","Interconnected surface water, ISW, gaining, losing",Yes,"Direct measurement of interactions between groundwater systems and surface water features is difficult because of the need for a monitoring system that tracks both stream stage and groundwater elevations at nearby locations (see Monitoring Network Section for the Butte Subbasin). Therefore, the interaction between the groundwater system and surface water features within the Butte Subbasin is analyzed through use of the BBGM (BCDWRC 2021) which, absent the presence of a monitoring system dedicated to assessing interactions at selected locations, integrates information from groundwater monitoring wells and stream stages to model gradients that control flow between surface water and groundwater.

&& The BBGM was utilized to evaluate stream segments within the subbasin and to classify them as being primarily gaining or losing over the historical period from water year 2000 to 2018. A total of 32 stream segments traversing or bounding the subbasin with a total length of approximately 140 miles were defined. The segments range in length from 1.5 to 7.7 miles with an average length of 4.4 miles and are shown in Figure 2‐27. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 2‐28. The figure shows the percent of months for the period from water year 2000 to 2018 with gaining conditions and classifies streams as primarily gaining (gaining conditions more than 80 percent of the time), primarily losing (losing conditions more than 80 percent of the time), or mixed. As indicated in Figure 2‐28, stream segments in the subbasin tend to be gaining more than 80 percent of the time, with the exception of segments of smaller streams near or along the northern boundary of the subbasin and segments of the Sacramento River from around five miles north of Glenn and to the south. One segment north of Glenn had estimated gains only seven percent of the time between 2000 and 2018.

&& To further evaluate the interconnectedness of streams with the groundwater system in the basin, streambed elevations at individual stream nodes from the BBGM were compared to groundwater elevations from spring groundwater level measurements provided by DWR as part of the SGMA Data Viewer17. Spring groundwater levels were available for 2014 to 2018. As indicated in Figure 2‐29, the vast majority of stream nodes within the Subbasin had spring groundwater levels at or above the estimated streambed elevation. Some stream nodes with groundwater elevations below the estimated streambed elevation occurred in the northernmost portions of the Subbasin. Based on consideration of the frequency with which stream segments are gaining based on BBGM results and on consideration of the spring depth to groundwater below the estimated streambed depth along each primary stream, it is likely that all streams traversing or bounding the subbasin are connected to the groundwater system. The presence of mixed or mostly losing reaches along the Sacramento River from north of Glenn south to approximately Princeton based on the BBGM results from 2000 to 2018 (refer to Figure 2‐28) is somewhat incongruous with the comparison of 2014 to 2018 spring groundwater elevations reported by DWR to stream node elevations estimated in the BBGM. This may result from differences in the time frames evaluated; differences in simulated groundwater elevations by the BBGM, which influence whether a stream segment is identified as gaining or losing, and groundwater elevations reported by DWR based on monitoring data; or uncertainty in streambed elevations estimated in the BBGM. Despite the incongruity, the available information suggests that streams are connected to the groundwater system and likely experienced gains in streamflow historically.

&& The timing and amount of surface water – groundwater interaction was estimated using the BBGM for the primary streams in the subbasin. Monthly net gains to streamflow from groundwater were estimated on a monthly basis ‐for the historical period from water year 2000 to 2018 and are summarized in Table 2‐5. Average monthly gains to streamflow are expressed in cubic feet per second. Negative values denote average losses from streamflow to groundwater (i.e., seepage or leakage).","Page 2-47 / 2.2.2.6.1

&& Figures 1 and 2 show the locations of all iGDEs identified by the NCCAG database within the Butte subbasin.

&& GSA Managers from the subbasin used this database as a starting point to analyze a portion of the total iGDEs in the NCCAG database to evaluate local groundwater dependence. The GSA Managers applied specific criteria to each polygon under analysis to answer a series of questions that led to an eventual characterization for each iGDE. These iGDEs were designated as either “Likely a GDE”, “Not likely a GDE” or “Uncertain” based on their evaluations. The criteria aimed at understanding each iGDE’s dependence on groundwater including questions about land use changes, proximity to perennial surface water supplies, irrigated agriculture and agricultural dependent surface water, condition of vegetation during drought years and water applications to the iGDEs. The first phase of the analysis was conducted by thorough review of aerial photographs from Google Earth across multiple years specifically focusing on the 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2015 drought years as well as use of the Managers’ local knowledge of these areas.

&& The iGDEs analyzed by the Managers in this initial effort, which did not receive a designation as either “Not likely a GDE” or “Likely a GDE” based on the conclusions from
the analysis above, were labeled as “Uncertain” and were analyzed in additional analyses as described below. Additional GIS Analysis: Irrigated Agricultural Land Use After the initial analysis was completed for a selection of the total iGDEs in the NCCAG database as described above, a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis was performed for all remaining iGDEs in this subbasin by Butte County staff to determine each iGDE’s proximity to rice and other irrigated agriculture as described below. The DWR / Land IQ land use and crop mapping data for 2016 (California Department of Water Resources, 2019) was used to determine the dominant crop type throughout the subbasin. Land classified as “Rice” for the “Crop Type 2016” in the dataset was identified. Then all polygons in the TNC iGDEs dataset within 150 feet of land classified as rice were identified and designated as “Not likely a GDE near irrigated rice” for the same reasons as described above in the “Not Likely a GDE Due to Adjacency to Irrigated Agricultural Fields” section of this document above. Land with “Crop Type 2016” classifications other than “Managed Wetland”, “Urban”, “Rice” and “Mixed Pasture” in the dataset were identified and for this purpose referenced as “Other Irrigated Agriculture” for this GIS analysis, as all other remaining irrigated crop types. All polygons in the NCCAG dataset within 50 feet of land classified as “Other Irrigated Agriculture” were designated as “Not likely a GDE near irrigated agriculture (Non-Rice)” for the same reasons as described above in the “Not Likely a GDE Due to Adjacency to Irrigated Agricultural Fields” section of this document.

In some areas historic mining activities have left tailings of cobbles and coarse gravel which rapidly transmit water. To some extent, it is assumed that pooled water in this area is tied to river stage through direct connections with the river with surface water bodies. Likewise, the reservoirs provide water year-round for adjacent ecosystems. If any iGDEs were located within 150 feet of reservoirs or mine tailings, they were assumed to be able to access the nearby surface water bodies and were labeled as “Not likely a GDE”.

&& Not Likely a GDE Due to Adjacency to Irrigated Agricultural Fields Agricultural lands are dependent on reliable water supplies to ensure a successful harvest. Surface water and / or groundwater pumped from the aquifer is used to irrigate crops in the Butte subbasin. Such irrigation benefits not only the crops, but also surrounding vegetation.
Potential GDEs further than 150 feet from irrigated rice fields and areas further than 50 feet from all other irrigated agriculture were assumed to be unable to access irrigation water. These distances are based on professional judgment, including past experience in the region and consideration of the physical characteristics of the Butte subbasin, such as hydraulic conductivity. Rice fields, along with other irrigated agriculture, are known to have percolation and lateral seepage, supplying water to the aquifer and into adjacent areas. Lateral seepage in Sacramento Valley rice areas has been estimated at between 1.0% and 1.9% of the total irrigation volume (LaHue & Lindquist, 2019). A larger distance was used for rice due to the long-term ponding of water and due to restrictive layers in the subsurface that result in the horizontal spreading of irrigation water. Potential GDEs near these irrigated areas are assumed to be accessing irrigation water through lateral movement through the soils, thus, they were labeled as “Not likely a GDE”.",PDF page 1040 / appendix 2E,"The plan did not technically remove any GDEs, but did map them as ""unlikely"" based on perennial surface water supplies and adjacency to irrigated fields.

4.2.4.3 Potential Effects of Undesirable Results
If groundwater quality were degraded such that undesirable levels are reached, the effects could potentially cause a shortage in supply to groundwater users without additional treatment, with domestic wells being most vulnerable as treatment costs or access to alternate supplies can be high for small users. High levels of salinity can impact both drinking water uses and agricultural uses, as there are maximum values associated with aesthetics (taste, color, and odor) for drinking water and crop health and yield for agriculture. &&&
4.2.4.4 Identification of Undesirable Results
Undesirable results for degraded groundwater quality are assessed through monitoring by collecting samples from representative monitoring site (RMS) wells and measuring electrical conductivity (EC) to analyze salinity, the key concern for groundwater quality in the Butte Subbasin that is considered to stem from a causal nexus with groundwater quantity‐related activities (ex. groundwater pumping). The GSAs have established a groundwater quality monitoring network for the collection of water quality data required to identify undesirable results. Undesirable results are considered to occur during GSP implementation if 25% of RMS wells (i.e., 3 of 9 RMS wells) exceed the established threshold value for EC for 24 consecutive months. Exceedance of MTs by 25% of RMS wells for 24 consecutive months was estimated to be an indicator of a significant, widespread problem causing undesirable results. No existing groundwater quality monitoring in the Butte Subbasin is deep enough or has sufficient information to adequately monitor groundwater quality in the very deep aquifer.

4.2.6.3 Potential Effects of Undesirable Results
If depletions of interconnected surface waters were to reach undesirable results levels, the effects could potentially reduce groundwater contribution to surface water courses (e.g. rivers and creeks), result in a reduction of the number of days per year a stream in the Subbasin flows, lower stream flows, and/or result in increased temperatures that could potentially impact riverine and riparian habitats through the reduction in the contribution of cooler groundwater flows to the surface water course.
4.2.6.4 Identification of Undesirable Results
The undesirable result for depletion of interconnected surface water is considered to occur during GSP implementation when 25% of interconnected surface water representative monitoring wells (i.e., 3 of 12 representative monitoring wells) fall below their minimum thresholds for 24 consecutive months. Minimum threshold exceedances at 25% of representative monitoring wells represents a “significant” number of affected wells in the RMS network, and exceedance of these levels (MTs) for 24 consecutive months or longer (as indicated by a lack of groundwater level recovery over two consecutive seasonal high periods) will potentially harm the “long‐term viability” of affected beneficial uses and users. The 25 percent of RMS wells below MTs for 24 consecutive months criterion was estimated to be an indicator of a significant, widespread problem, potentially leading to undesirable results.

As described in Section 2 Basin Setting, salinity is the primary constituent of concern in the Butte Subbasin due to concerns around the migration of connate water upwelling from the very deep aquifer near the Sutter Buttes. A preliminary minimum threshold for salinity (measured as electrical conductivity or EC) was proposed for the Subbasin. The minimum threshold for electrical conductivity in water quality representative monitoring wells was set as the higher of 900 μs/cm or the measured historical high, whichever is greater. This minimum threshold was set based on best available data, the Butte County Basin Management Objective program, and maximum contamination levels (MCLs). However, because of the short record of available groundwater quality data, the GSAs will review and revise the preliminary minimum thresholds and approach during the 5‐year GSP update. As part of GSP implementation, the GSAs will continue to monitor and may expand its groundwater quality representative monitoring Network. Figure 3‐3 in Section 3 Monitoring Networks show the location of the wells in the groundwater quality representative monitoring network. The GSAs will also consider setting minimum thresholds for other constituents as part of the 5‐ year update.

4.3.6.1 Minimum Thresholds
Minimum thresholds for depletion of interconnected surface waters were set at 10 feet below the measured historical low for each of the representative monitoring wells. The minimum threshold was established to prevent undesirable results while taking into consideration key water bodies (including the Sacramento River, Feather River, Butte Creek, Little Dry Creek, Dry Creek, and Angel Slough) and groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs). The minimum threshold was selected such that levels would be protective of the beneficial use of interconnected surface water and of shallower groundwater near streams and rivers, including those of shallower domestic users and potential groundwater dependent ecosystems. The additional 10 feet in depth below the measured historical low (during which no undesirable results were observed) is intended to provide an appropriate margin of operational flexibility during GSP implementation. While information and understanding of interconnected surface waters is limited, groundwater levels that exceed the minimum threshold in the future for an  extended period of time could impact beneficial uses of interconnected surface waters by reducing the volume and changing the timing of surface water availability, and potentially impacting the beneficial uses of groundwater by dewatering domestic wells and limiting groundwater supplies to groundwater dependent ecosystems. As additional data are collected during GSP implementation, minimum thresholds may change and the threshold calculations revised to reflect a better understanding of this complex interaction and the Subbasin’s unique  conditions.
Figure 4‐5 shows the MTs for each well in the interconnected surface water representative monitoring network. RMS wells were selected within a one‐mile band surrounding rivers and streams, at distances of between 2,000 feet and 7,280 feet from those waterways. Selected RMS wells had either a total depth of less than 150 feet bgs, or a top screen above 100 feet bgs and a bottom screen above 200 feet bgs.

Another negative impact to the groundwater system that can result from irrigated agriculture is the degradation of groundwater quality occurring from excess application of nutrients (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) and pesticides or herbicides. As applied water infiltrates the ground and percolates to the aquifer, it can transport excess nutrients, pesticides, or herbicides applied on the land surface during crop production. At high concentrations, these materials are a health concern if this groundwater is pumped and used for human consumption. Improving on‐farm nutrient management and efficiency of nutrient application will save on‐farm costs and reduce the nutrient influx to the groundwater system. &&&

5.9 Installation of Additional Shallow Monitoring Wells
5.9.1 Overview
This project will install shallow monitoring wells in areas of the subbasin where the GSAs are interested in monitoring potential hydrologic impacts to interconnected surface water and groundwater dependent ecosystems. This project is designed to address data gaps identified in the GSP in Section 4.4, and will support ongoing monitoring of interconnected surface water and groundwater dependent ecosystems.
5.9.2 Implementation
The GSAs are planning to install 10 additional shallow wells to improve monitoring of surface water depletion and GDEs. All 10 of the new shallow wells will provide monitoring for GDEs and seven of the wells will be sited at locations to allow them to be added to the interconnected surface water representative monitoring network (RMN). The new shallow wells include two near the Sacramento River, two near Butte Creek, one near Little Dry Creek, one near Angel Slough and one near Feather River (Figure 5‐2). These locations and densities of monitoring sites follow the guidelines suggested by EDF (2021). &&&

5.5 Boundary Flow and Primary Spill Measurement Projects
Western Canal Water District (WCWD) has planned and is in the early stages of implementing a boundary flow and primary spill measurement project at three key outflow sites in its distribution system. The boundary flow and primary spill measurement project is part of the district’s comprehensive plan for system modernization and boundary flow monitoring developed as part of the Feather River Regional Agricultural Water Management Plan (FRRAWMP). Detailed information about the plan is 3884 included in the FRRAWMP and in project documentation included in Appendix 5.D. &&&
Water quality: To the extent there are times when the quality of return flows to Butte Creek is not optimal for species of interest in Butte Creek, there is a potential to implement water conservation measures to reduce these return flows and enhance water quality in Butte Creek. Other benefits of this project are also anticipated. Conserved water could be utilized to increase flow in the Feather River at strategic times, benefitting endangered species such as Chinook Salmon and Steelhead Trout. Water conserved by this project could also be used by others who rely on water from the Feather River, including State Water Project contractors and downstream disadvantaged communities (DACs) that may benefit from recharge and water supply from the Feather River.","Page 5-48 / 5.8.1.4

The program will provide growers with educational resources that help them to plan and implement on‐farm practices that simultaneously support groundwater sustainability and maintain or improve agricultural productivity. Implementation of these on‐farm practices will be recorded, along with estimated or measured benefits to groundwater sustainability resulting from these practices. Four categories of on‐farm practices, or on‐farm management actions, that may be covered in this program are:
1. Maximizing the use of surface water (e.g. “in‐lieu” recharge),
2. Managing soils to improve infiltration and root zone soil moisture storage,
3. Reducing (and minimizing) non‐beneficial ET, and
4. Precision nutrient management.

The use of surface water for irrigation whenever it is available is a crucial practice to support  sustainable groundwater management. The use of surface water both offsets local groundwater demand through reduced groundwater pumping (“in‐lieu” recharge) and increases groundwater recharge through the non‐consumptive recoverable flow of deep percolation of applied surface water from the land surface to the underlying aquifer.","Page 5-45 / 5.8.1

Measurable objectives expected to benefit from this project are:
 Groundwater levels and groundwater storage: This project will increase water supply reliability, helping to meet customer water crop water needs using surface water supply. This is expected to offset groundwater pumping needs, particularly in curtailment years, and supply on‐farm recharge of surface water to the groundwater system.
&&
A program that promotes dual source irrigation systems is expected to benefit measurable objectives related to groundwater levels and groundwater storage. By encouraging growers to use surface water when it is available, dual source irrigation systems provide: 
 In‐lieu groundwater recharge: In fields formerly irrigated exclusively using groundwater, surface water applied through a dual source irrigation system will offset a similar volume of groundwater pumping, leaving that groundwater in the underlying aquifer for future beneficial use.
 Direct groundwater recharge: Irrigation provides a significant volume of recharge through deep percolation of applied water. As irrigators have shifted from surface irrigation toward pressurized irrigation using groundwater, the proportion of deep percolation supplied by surface water has decreased. Even though the low‐volume irrigation techniques used to apply groundwater minimize the total volume of water needed to satisfy crop demands, this shift in water source results in a net depletion of groundwater (i.e., more extraction than recharge) rather than a net recharge observed from application of surface water. Irrigating with surface water thus supports groundwater sustainability by supplying more surface water to the groundwater system through in‐field recharge.
