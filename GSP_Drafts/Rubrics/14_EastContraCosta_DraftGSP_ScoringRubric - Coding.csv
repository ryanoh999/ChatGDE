,,,"ISWs: Decent assessment, but lack of data. The plan labels the western portion of the basin as ""probably disconnected"" without adaquate groundwater data. Data gaps and potential ISWs could be described/mapped better.
GDEs: The plan described their process of GDE assessment well. No groundwater data used due to lack of adaquate spatial distribtion of GDE monitoring wells. Data gaps were identified and pGDEs were mapped and briefly described.
SMC: The MO section needs more detail for beneficial users. Deeper evaluation is needed in SMC section. 
PMA: Although they have plans either completed or planned, they haven't gone into detail how it will benefit beneficial users, GDE, DAC, .... Even although they have multiple WQ projects, they hardly mention benefits to any beneficial users.
WQ: They have done a good job presenting all the constitutes that they have been monitoring.
CLIMATE CHANGE: Water budget did a good job incorporating CC (2070 CT) into future projections for ET, precip, surface flow, sea level rise. Projected sustainable yield based off projected budget components.
OTHER: No use of Open ET, but references potential water market and requiring meters in the future. PMAs did a good job addressing supply augmentation, but demand reduction was rather lacking.
Stakeholders: Documented a lot of information about DACs and DAC populations, some of the most detailed assessments of populations, includes well depth by location maps (which most GSP fail to include), states to not have any federally recgonized Tribes but name two tribes as stakeholders.

&&

Disadvantaged Communities: The disadvantaged areas (DAs) are described in Section 2.3.2. The total DAC population in the Subbasin is approximately 35,600 (Table 2-5). All DAs are served by small water systems, municipal water, or individual domestic wells (Figures 2-13a and 2-13b). SGMA has limited authority with regards to water quality improvements related to drinking water beneficial uses. Despite these limitations, GSAs represent the interests of the DAs (e.g., the City of Antioch, DWD, Contra Costa County, 1 Native American Heritage Commission, 1550 Harbor Blvd., Ste. 100, West Sacramento, CA 95691, (916) 373-3710.and the City of Brentwood). The interests of the DAs are reflected in the sustainability goal and sustainable management criteria described in Section 7.

5.2.2.2 Disadvantaged Communities
Messages developed for this sector should be tailored and specific to the community. This type of outreach is often best served by use of surrogates and trusted messengers. These messages should be aligned with activities of the Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) Plan. Messages about ways to access the increased availability of resources due to grant incentives should also be considered. ECC Subbasin Disadvantaged Communities and Economically.

There are no known federally designated tribal lands or tribes in the Subbasin. The Sonoma Northwest Information Center (NWIC) (Sonoma State) searched for sacred lands, and none were found in the area. The Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) record search returned no information for the Subbasin. NAHC further recommended contacting individual tribal leaders and provided a list of seven people for the GSAs to contact.

The focus of messaging for this group being on how the GSP development will contribute to a sustainable regional water portfolio which includes surface water sustainability. Special effort should be made to identify specific topics of interest.

GSAs in the Subbasin should conduct a variety of public outreach activities to inform, engage, and respond to stakeholders and other interested parties during GSP development, adoption, and implementation. These activities function to inform stakeholders about SGMA and the GSP, collect information important to groundwater sustainability planning, and receive feedback on the GSP or other public documents. Regular communication with stakeholders and the public will be a key component to the successful adoption and implementation of the GSP. Some outreach activities identified in this section should be timed with GSP development milestones, while others should be conducted on regular or semi-regular basis. GSAs in the Subbasin should collaboratively develop a stakeholder communications and outreach calendar in association with the overall planning schedule. Outreach tools identified in Section 6.2 should be used promote, conduct, and track implementation of the tactics identified in this section. As described in Subsection 7.2.8, all outreach activities described in this section should be documented. 7.3.1 Communications Workbook A separate East Contra Costa Subbasin Communications Workbook (Appendix D) provides lists of required activities for each GSA. The workbook will also assist in document outreach activities. 7.3.2 Outreach Survey A survey to all interested parties was distributed in November-December 2018. The purpose of the survey was two-fold, first to provide some basic GSP education and second to receive input from the interested parties on any topics or concerns for inclusion in the GSP deliberations. The questions were framed to facilitate input on GSP topics. While limited, input provided during the survey was useful. 7.3.3 GSA Board Meetings and Workshops GSA board meetings are the forum where key GSA decisions are presented, discussed, and decided. Presentations at GSA Board meetings also provide an opportunity to engage with the public and stakeholders in the decision-making process for development of the GSP. GSA representatives should verify with their legal counsel whether their GSA board’s meetings are subject to the Brown Act and may be conducted with existing meetings for that agency’s board or elected body (e.g. city council, board of supervisors, board of directors). The GSP Coordination Group members should provide regular updates to their GSA boards regarding the status of GSP development and public outreach activities. These representatives should assess East Contra Costa Subbasin Sustainable Groundwater Management Act Communications Plan SEP 2018 33 their Board’s level of knowledge regarding groundwater topics early in GSP development process and assess the need for a “groundwater 101” type workshop. 7.3.4 Public and Stakeholder Workshops In support of GSP development, GSAs may host workshops to present technical findings, exchange information with stakeholders, and solicit public and stakeholder feedback on the public draft GSP or other public documents. Workshops may be planned and implemented by individuals GSAs or coordinated as a Subbasin-wide activity. Coordinated workshops will be planned at GSP Coordination Group meetings. At this time, it anticipated that individual Boards will have publicly noticed workshop items as part of their regular Board meeting agendas. The workshops will be primarily informational, with the purpose of informing stakeholder and members of public about the basics of SGMA and the GSP development process. Further opportunities for stakeholders to get involved should be identified at that time. The GSAs should hold additional workshops throughout the GSP planning process to inform stakeholders about and receive feedback on key GSP topics. The timing of these workshops should be aligned with key milestones as identified in the project schedule. 7.3.5 Speaking Engagements Efforts should be made to conduct outreach at events or meetings that already occur (e.g. Farm Bureau meetings, Rotary Club, etc.). The purpose of these presentations is to build and maintain awareness about SGMA and the GSP, encourage participation at public GSP development workshops, and encourage enrollment in the Interested Parties Databases. The GSAs should develop a list of knowledgeable presenters in the event that an organization or other entity would like a presentation. Branded outreach materials, such as template presentation slides and handouts, should be readily available for these presenters. The initial round of presentations should focus on increasing awareness of SGMA and expanding the Interested Parties Database. Speaker engagements should be recorded in the overall outreach record and reported at Coordination Group meetings. 7.3.6 Existing Outreach Venues GSAs should fully leverage the activities of existing groups. A list of potential presentation venues is provided in Section 4.1. This list should be developed into a full Outreach Venues Database, described in Subsection 7.2.7. This database should be referenced when there is a need to deploy information. GSAs may conduct informal outreach with the leaders of such groups to determine the best way to interact. GSAs should also determine what communications channels these groups are using and equally leverage these. For example, GSAs may place articles or event postings in group newsletters at little or no charge.

For that reason, there is a need for press releases and/or guest editorials to offer the media and stakeholders accurate information offered in the context of SGMA. This type of outreach should be closely coordinated as consistency in messages is critical to stakeholder acceptance.

Groundwater quality in the Subbasin is characterized for this section through a variety of tables, maps and graphs. The entire water quality data set is provided in Appendix 3f. Key groundwater quality constituents discussed below include total dissolved solids (TDS), nitrate, chloride, arsenic, boron, and mercury. These constituents were selected because they have the potential to influence sustainability (as opposed to localized, or site-specific contamination). A concern for domestic water supply, including individual domestic wells and large public water systems serving municipalities, is groundwater hardness. This concern is included as a sustainability issue in Section 7 Sustainable Management Criteria. &&&
Mercury Marsh Creek runs from Mt. Diablo through Brentwood and out to the San Joaquin River and drains water from the Mt. Diablo Mercury Mine operated from 1849 to 1971. There is potential for rainwater to leach mercury from mine tailings and to flow into the Marsh Creek watershed. However, there is no evidence that mercury has contaminated groundwater in the Subbasin and no wells in the ECC Subbasin tested form mercury have exceeded the MCL (2 ug/L).
Appendix 3f is a table of all groundwater quality (general minerals and trace elements) in the Subbasin, by zone. Most of the wells in the Subbasin are missing construction information so water quality for the Shallow and Deep Zones is limited.
In summary, groundwater in the Subbasin generally exceeds or is near the recommended SMCL for TDS (500 mg/L) and chloride (250 mg/l) (Table 3-2). The observed concentrations may reflect a naturally higher baseline for these constituents (LSCE 1999). Nitrate is observed in some Shallow Zone areas (i.e., Brentwood) in the Subbasin, with concentrations generally exceeding the MCL (10 mg/L) that may be linked to past agricultural influences in the area. Arsenic concentrations are generally less than the MCL (10 ug/L) basin wide. Boron concentrations are high in most wells and are attributed to a naturally elevated baseline. Groundwater serves a variety of domestic and agricultural uses throughout the Subbasin with limited restrictions due to natural (salinity and boron) and anthropogenic (nitrate) causes. The availability of surface water gives the opportunity to mitigate these issues when necessary. Depending on local groundwater quality, the stringent municipal standards for drinking water are met by a mix of water sources: City of Antioch uses surface water only, DWD and Brentwood blend groundwater with surface water, and TODB uses groundwater only. The ECC Subbasin’s groundwater quality is generally stable which indicates that groundwater extraction is not degrading water quality and the Subbasin is being operated within its sustainable yield. &&&
Groundwater Contamination Sites
Figures 3-21a and b illustrate the open and closed groundwater contamination sites in the ECC Subbasin. Contaminated sites can pose a hazard to human health through the contamination of aquifers if the area is using groundwater. Contamination site data were obtained from GeoTracker (online resource) and are divided into cleanup program sites, leaky underground storage tank (LUST) sites, and land disposal sites. Appendix 3h lists the 35 open sites and 105 closed sites including the potential contaminants of concern for each site. The majority of sites are in Antioch followed by Brentwood. The most common contaminant is hydrocarbon for both open and closed sites.","Page 3-46 / 3.3.5

The Subbasin has three water source types: surface water (primary source about 80,000 AFY); groundwater (secondary source about 8,000 AFY); and recycled water (about 2,700 AFY) (IRWMP, 2019, based on 2010 Urban Water Management Plans). Land use by water source in the ECC Subbasin is shown in Figure 2-15. Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is practiced throughout much of the Subbasin. Urban centers water sources vary The City of Antioch uses surface water exclusively, while the Cities of Brentwood and Oakley (water provided by DWD) use a combination of surface water and groundwater, and the Town of Discovery Bay uses only groundwater. ECCID and BBID hold water rights to divert surface water from Old River and meet remaining demand with groundwater. The unincorporated portions of the Subbasin generally have surface water as the water source however, these amounts are not quantified. The exceptions to this are domestic users and small community water systems which rely on groundwater. The Ironhouse Sanitary District uses recycled water to irrigate crops for animal feed on Jersey Island (2,700 AF in 2010).","ES-2

In the western portion of the Subbasin a few creeks are present that are considered a natural source of recharge to the Subbasin (Figure 3-24) and have the potential to be considered interconnected systems. Marsh Creek, the most prominent, is earthen lined and channelized, and is adjacent to both the City of Brentwood and DWD pumping wells. It may be vulnerable to impacts from the loss of interconnected surface water due to groundwater pumping and groundwater level declines.

The ECC GSP defines significant and unreasonable chronic lowering of groundwater levels as:  Unreasonable reduction or loss of water well capacity that cannot be mitigated, applies to: o Agricultural wells o Commercial o Domestic supply wells  Municipal supply wells  Small water system wells  Private domestic wells o Industrial wells&&&
7.3.1.4. Potential Effects of Undesirable Results
A potential effect for the chronic lowering of Shallow Zone groundwater levels is the potential impact to domestic well owners whose wells may go dry and decrease shallow water available to groundwater dependent ecosystems. These changes could impact property values, quality of life, and environment in the ECC Subbasin. Changes in groundwater levels in the Deep Zone where pumping for large systems serving municipalities occurs could impact groundwater supply reliability and increase costs for consumers throughout the Subbasin.&&&
7.3.4.1. Undesirable Results
Significant and unreasonable changes in groundwater quality as a result of implementing sustainable management policies, projects, or other actions could occur if they cause any of the following:  Increases in concentrations of key groundwater quality constituents above drinking water maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) that reduce groundwater availability for domestic, agricultural, municipal, or environmental beneficial uses.  Changes in water quality that cause economic burdens placed on users to treat or replace sources of groundwater supply including but not limited to increased treatment costs to mitigate elevated mineral content such as hardness.  Adverse impacts to agricultural crop production, yield, and/or quality.  Migration of contaminants to domestic or agricultural sources of supply.  Movement or increases in currently unregulated chemical constituents that adversely impact beneficial uses and users of groundwater. &&&
Overall, groundwater quality is satisfactory for the various beneficial uses in the ECC Subbasin. Some parts of the Subbasin experience naturally elevated TDS and chloride that are near or exceed the recommended SMCL indicating a higher baseline for these constituents. Elevated nitrate concentrations occur in shallow wells near Brentwood with concentrations exceeding the MCL attributable to past agricultural practices. Arsenic is generally less than the MCL and boron concentrations are naturally elevated in most wells. Water hardness varies and in some cases adds financial burdens on users needing to use water softeners. For municipalities, TDS and hardness may lead to customer dissatisfaction and limit the ability to blend groundwater with treated surface water under conjunctive use. In order to meeting customer water hardness expectations municipalities may be required to install expensive water treatment systems. &&&

The TDS minimum threshold of 1,000 mg/L is generally protective for domestic and agricultural uses. TDS is secondary standard established for aesthetic purposes such as taste, odor, and color and not based on public health concerns. Note: public water system threshold of 500 mg/L for TDS.

Table 7‐4 presents the measurable objectives for each RMS. If a RMS does not have groundwater quality data during this period, the cells are left blank, and it will be calculated after five years of data collection.
Since the groundwater quality in the Subbasin is currently sustainable and above minimum thresholds for all RMSs (Figure 6‐5), the interim milestones are set at the same values as the measurable objectives shown in Table 7‐4. No changes in quality are expected from projects and management actions implemented to achieve sustainability.","Page 7-25 / 7.3.4.7

",NO: no mention Somewhat: mention vaguely &/ only for one MT section YES: mention in both MT sections and use quantitative data to justify/describe,"minimum threshold, disadvantaged communit*, drinking water users, domestic, domestic wells, groundwater levels, water quality, groundwater quality",Yes,"Based on the modeling results, minimum thresholds for chronic lowering of groundwater levels are quantified using the lowest historical water levels observed in a well plus 10 feet. If the MT in any well is exceeded over three consecutive years, indicating a trend, and do not recover in normal to wet years, undesirable results would be evaluated in terms of affects related to sustainable management activities Since groundwater levels in the ECC Subbasin have been stable historically through the present and are projected to remain that way in the future, this is a conservative approach that will be adapted as additional groundwater level data and experience is accumulated. The modeling tool developed in (Section 5) provides additional support for the conservative nature of this approach.&&&
The minimum thresholds for chronic lowering of groundwater levels at each RMS is set at an elevation, when evaluated collectively, that could produce undesirable results in the ECC Subbasin. They are the following: 1. The minimum threshold for each RMS is set at a level for which the sustainable yield is exceeded based on groundwater flow model scenario (see Section 5). 2. Where chronic level declines do not exceed the sustainable yield, but otherwise cause undesirable results as described in this GSP. 3. For domestic wells, a minimum threshold which indicates that the 10th percentile of this category experiences a drop below the top perforations within the section where the RMS is located. This is considered protective of the water supply sustainability because it considers the most sensitive conditions of well operations.&&&
Information on domestic wells installed in the past 30 years and for which perforation intervals were listed was downloaded from DWR’s Well Completion Report Map Application (DWR, 2019) dataset. Figure 7‐3 shows the number of wells (color coded) and the shallowest well perforations (numeric value in each square). There is a wide range of completion interval for this category of well with the shallowest perforations indicating that some wells pump, at least partially, from the Shallow Zone, while the deeper perforations target only the Deep Zone. Wells completed in the Shallow Zone are generally isolated from pumping in the Deep Zone, where most pumping occurs in the Subbasin, by confining zones that prevent propagation of impacts vertically. Wells that pump solely in the Shallow Zone will ultimately be protected through the MTs and MOs being developed through expansion of shallow monitoring throughout the Subbasin. The Deep Zone wells will be protected through the MTs and MOs assigned to the RMS in Table 7‐2.&&&
Rural residential land uses and users. The chronic lowering of groundwater level minimum thresholds protects most domestic users of groundwater by considering the depths to which wells are completed and protection of reasonable operating margins for available pumping drawdown. Urban land uses and users. The chronic lowering of groundwater level minimum thresholds are set so that existing and projected water demands can be met through typical well and pumping configurations
(e.g., depths, perforation intervals, pumping lifts).&&&
7.3.4.6. Information Used and Methodology The information used to establish the degraded groundwater quality minimum threshold includes:  Historical groundwater quality from basin‐wide monitoring wells in the ECC Subbasin.  Depths and locations of existing wells.  Federal and state drinking water quality standards.  Information from interested parties of significant and unreasonable conditions. Federal and state drinking water quality standards will be used to define degraded groundwater quality minimum thresholds. &&&
Rural residential land uses and users. The groundwater quality minimum thresholds protect domestic users of groundwater by applying drinking water standards.
Urban land uses and users. The groundwater quality minimum thresholds protect municipal supplies by applying the same drinking water standards required under state permits.

These would only be included as part of GSP implementation as needed in any areas where sustainable groundwater conditions are not maintained. Through reducing overall water demand, this action would potentially provide a benefit to all measurable objectives. General types of demand management programs include:
• Allocation. An allocation may be directly coupled with pumping limits. Under an allocation, the different sources of groundwater are quantified and allocated to individual parcels, wells, or entities (such as, for example, farming operations). By defining the quantities of groundwater available to individuals, this can incentivize reductions in use and development of new recharge opportunities. An allocation is a rigid method for implementing demand management. It effectively limits water use on a well, parcel, or operation basis. This could require idling land or switching crop or landscape on lands that have insufficient allocation to meet irrigation demand, which imposes costs on water users (e.g., growers). There are ways to increase the flexibility of allocations to reduce the costs of demand management. For example, the allocation could be defined as an average over a period of time rather than a fixed amount every year, or users could be allowed to carry over unused allocation into the next year.
• Allocation + Water Market. An allocation that is less than historical water use can be coupled with a water market. A groundwater market is another way to increase the flexibility of an allocation to reduce costs of demand management. A market is an institution that allows willing buyers and sellers to exchange groundwater allocation (“credits”). More broadly, a market creates a means to exchange allocation with another groundwater user, whether for a single season or using a multi-year trade. Willing sellers trade a part of their allocation to willing buyers in exchange for a payment that the seller expects will exceed the return he/she would have earned from using the water for irrigation. This additional flexibility reduces the cost to the GSA’s users of achieving demand reduction under an allocation. Development of a water market institution is a complex process that encompasses more than defining the groundwater allocation. This investigation would be initiated by the GSAs in the future, if needed.
• Land Repurposing. Land repurposing programs are more targeted than an allocation or market program but maintain flexibility for participants by its voluntary nature. Such a program would provide a financial incentive to willing participants for their currently irrigated lands to be repurposed into other, non-irrigated uses. Programs can focus on short-term drought conditions, or they can provide multi-year reductions in demand if that is needed under some conditions. For longer-term programs, lands can be repurposed to achieve other multi-benefit objectives - for example, to create habitat corridors or to support local endangered species.
• Other financial incentives. Demand management can also be achieved through a range of other financial incentives. This could include positive financial incentives to reduce consumptive groundwater use. It could also include groundwater extraction fees that disincentivize groundwater use.

The Subbasin Sustainability Goal broadly includes maintaining safe and reliable access to groundwater, assessing and managing groundwater in the future under climate change, protecting the sustainable yield, and continuing to avoid undesirable results of groundwater extraction as defined by Subbasin stakeholders.
Projects and management actions (PMAs) were developed to achieve the ECC Subbasin sustainability goal by 2042 and avoid undesirable results over the GSP planning and implementation horizon. Given the current and projected stability and sustainability of groundwater in the ECC Subbasin, PMAs are developed with the goal of maintaining sustainable groundwater conditions. PMAs include a suite of targeted PMAs that the GSAs may develop and implement, if needed under future conditions. The GSP also includes some PMAs that are expected to be implemented (or are already being implemented) by individual GSAs in the Subbasin to maintain sustainability.",Page 8-1 / 8.0,"Basin stated not to be in overdraft, and thus PMAs will not close any gap. PMAs will maintain sustainability however, with many PMAs already complete or under construction"

Somewhat: no somewhat for this question
Yes: New water markets are referenced or proposed",water market,Yes,"• Allocation + Water Market. An allocation that is less than historical water use can be coupled with a water market. A groundwater market is another way to increase the flexibility of an allocation to reduce costs of demand management. A market is an institution that allows willing buyers and sellers to exchange groundwater allocation (“credits”). More broadly, a market creates a means to exchange allocation with another groundwater user, whether for a single season or using a multi-year trade. Willing sellers trade a part of their allocation to willing buyers in exchange for a payment that the seller expects will exceed the return he/she would have earned from using the water for irrigation. This additional flexibility reduces the cost to the GSA’s users of achieving demand reduction under an allocation. Development of a water market institution is a complex process that encompasses more than defining the groundwater allocation. This investigation would be initiated by the GSAs in the future, if needed.",Page 8-28 / 8.2.1.6,"Trading of pumping credits mentioned, though this is merely a conceptual PMA that will only be implemented if needed to maintain sustainability"

Yes: Explicitly identifies climate change as a reason for obtaining/crossing thresholds for SMC",climate change,Somewhat,"There is no evidence that groundwater levels are chronically declining in the ECC Subbasin, and they are not expected to do so in the future. However, SGMA regulations require the GSP to identify future conditions (over 50 years) that may lead to chronically declining water levels, and they could include the following:
 Significantly worse hydrologic conditions than currently projected under climate change scenarios (see Section 5).
 Regulatory changes in streamflow requirements imposed by the SWRCB that reduce long standing surface‐water rights and supplies.
 Expansion of pumping in place of existing surface water supply source. Expansion of pumping may induce localized drawdowns and groundwater level declines.
 Changes in the historical management of the Delta and salinity control point.
The above hypothetical causes are considered unlikely under projected land and water uses and the cooperative regional water supply coordination among GSAs and other agencies. In addition, factors such as climate change and sea level rise are included in the ECC Subbasin groundwater budget as described in (Section 5).
&&
The ECC Subbasin has experienced no long‐term reduction in groundwater storage due to pumpage or other imbalance in the water budget. Although unlikely, hypothetical conditions that may lead to a reduction in groundwater storage include the following:
 Prolonged drought. An extensive drought greater than planned for may cause increased pumping of groundwater and a reduction of groundwater storage to a significant and unreasonable level.
 Regulatory changes in streamflow requirements imposed by the SWRCB that reduce long standing surface‐water rights and supplies.
 Expansion of pumping and reduced surface water use.
The above hypothetical causes are considered unlikely under projected land and water use estimates even when the effects of climate change and sea level rise are considered (see Section 5).
