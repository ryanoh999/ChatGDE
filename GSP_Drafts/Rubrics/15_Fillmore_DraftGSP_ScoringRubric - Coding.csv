GDE: Like the ISW section, the plan itself includes few details but Appendix D provides a thorough overview of the GDEs with maps and tables of flora and fauna. Only spring of 2019 groundwater data was used to assess GDEs. Other methods were used including rooting depths and aerial imagery.
SMC: The SMC section is a duplicate of Piru GSP, they have done a good job on evaluation GW level but haven't done any specific evaluation specificully on GW quality on SMC section.

However, high TDS and chloride persisted in Santa Clara River in surface water sampled near the County Line and in local groundwater after passage of the Clean Water Act. The main water quality concern over the past couple of decades for agricultural users in Piru Basin (and to a lesser extent in the down-gradient Fillmore Basin) has been impacts associated with Santa Clara River (SCR) perennial surface water base flows sourcing from Los Angeles County (UWCD, 2016). These base flows percolate to groundwater in east Piru Basin and contain elevated chloride tertiary treated water from the Valencia Reclamation Plant that discharges to the Upper SCR. The elevated chloride concentrations in Valencia plant discharge in the Upper SCR are influenced by chloride in imported State Water, as Castaic Lake Water Agency delivers State Water to water retailers in the greater Santa Clarita area (UWCD, 2016) (see GSP subsection 2.2.2.5.3 Point Sources of Groundwater Pollutants). Historically water quality chemicals (analytes or constituents) of concern (COCs) in the Fillmore and Piru basins have generally included, but are not necessarily limited to, the following analytes:• Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)2 • Sulfate3 • Chloride 4 • Nitrate5 • Boron &&& 
Additional Potential COCs
Additional potential COCs in the Fillmore Basin were identified in the FPBGSA Monitoring 3 Program and Data Gap Tech Memo (DBS&A, 2021a and Appendix K) from a review of available groundwater quality data, the most recent Annual Report of Groundwater Conditions (VCWPD, 2016) and Piru/Fillmore Basins Groundwater Conditions report (UWCD, 2016). These additional chemicals include: • Radiochemistry (gross alpha and uranium) • Selenium • Lead • Iron and Manganese. Systematic trend analysis was not performed for these analytes in the TM since sufficient datasets were not available or the chemical has not historically been raised as a prominent concern in the Fillmore and/or Piru basins (i.e., iron and manganese). With the exception of iron and manganese concentration mapping, a wide evaluation time period window was required to assemble adequate analytical data for geospatial evaluation. Narrower time-period windows are preferred for comparative analysis from well-to-well than were used in the TM evaluation but the exercise was useful in detecting potential areas in the Basins that may have elevated chemical concentrations that should be investigated further. The TM includes four figures (not duplicated here in the GSP) that show maximum concentration plotted in map view.

 ISW map and ISWs were delineated using multiple water year types AND description of temporal variability= yes","Interconnected surface water, ISW, gaining, losing",Somewhat,"Two interconnected surface water systems have been identified along the Santa Clara River channel (Figure 2.2-10): (1) at the Basin boundaries with Santa Paula basin (i.e., East Grove or Willard Road area) and (2) with Piru basin (i.e., Cienega and Fillmore Fish Hatchery area). These areas are commonly referred to as areas of rising groundwater, where streams are considered gaining flow from groundwater (Figure 2.2-29a). 
&& 
Surface water depletion estimates (Figure 2.2-30b) at the two rising groundwater locations along the Santa Clara River (Figure 2.2-10) exhibit wide variability, ranging from zero depletion (when the rising groundwater ceases to flow during droughts) to up to 10 and 20 cfs at the Willard Road and Fish Hatchery areas, respectively. 
&& 
Depletions are quantified by running two model scenarios, one with historical pumping rates and another with a hypothetical 50% reduction in pumping (Basinwide), and subtracting the surface water flows associated with each scenario. Surface water flows are quantified based on groundwater levels simulated at the same two wells (04N19W25M01S and 03N20W02A01S) that are used to derive the correlation between surface water flows and groundwater levels. The VRGWFM demonstrates 1 excellent calibration of groundwater levels at these wells (United, 2021a [Appendix E]).

&& Surface waters within the Piru and Fillmore groundwater basins have varying degrees of connection to groundwater. Generally, surface waters can be categorized into three major surface water types: perennial reaches, intermittent reaches, and ephemeral reaches. For this discussion we define perennial reaches as those that have surface flow except during prolonged and severedroughts. For the Santa Clara River, perennial reaches are generally supported by rising groundwater and are areas of interconnected surface water (UCWD 2017). Surface flows occur for prolonged periods in intermittent reaches, but the reaches tend to go dry during most years. Ephemeral reaches occur in smaller tributaries within the basin and only support surface flow immediately after storm events.

&& The Santa Clara River in the Fillmore Groundwater Basin has two reaches with rising groundwater (i.e., interconnected surface water) that correspond to the Cienega and the East Grove GDE units. Surface flows in both of these reaches are typically dominated by rising groundwater except during storm flows. The rising groundwater flows can be supplemented by man-made releases from Santa Felicia Dam or Castaic Lake. The extent of rising groundwater (the source of the perennial flow) varies based on water year type (see section 4.3.3 for a discussion). Between these two reaches the Santa Clara River is an intermittent, losing reach for approximately 5 miles. Sespe Creek is perennial at the USGS gage near the Fillmore Groundwater Basin boundary (where the creek exits the mountains) but the downstream extent of perennial flow is not known, although the lower portion of Sespe Creek is intermittent. Other tributaries within the Fillmore Groundwater Basin, including Pole Creek, Boulder Creek, and Timber Creek, are typically ephemeral or intermittent (i.e., disconnected from groundwater). United Water mapped the extent of surface water from 2011–2017 and that is explored below.","Page 2-57 / 2.2.2.7

This figure is very poorly done and marks two areas of the Santa Clara River as ""GW Discharge Area"". The river itself is not labeled as interconnected. No inclusion of gaining or losing. Figure 2.2-10 and 2.2-11 present the entire Santa Clara River as perennial (which the plan says that perennial =  ISW in appendix D), yet the ISW section states that only two areas of the river are interconnected. Clarification is needed.
2. Was temporal variability and used and described? somewhat - no temporal variability is described in the ISW section, but Appendix E describes the model used to estimate ISW depletions calibrated groundwater levels from 1985-2015, but there is a lack of detail.
3. Methods: Are there sufficient data (well locations in proximity to streams, well density, screening depths) to inform assessment?

These areas are commonly referred to as areas of rising groundwater, where streams are considered gaining flow from groundwater (Figure 2.2-29a). 


&&Data gaps remain regarding identifying the extent and timing of interconnectedness of other stream channel areas (e.g., Sespe Creek and central portions of the Santa Clara River), due to a lack of paired groundwater level and surface water level monitoring sites. Stream conditions here are considered to vary between all three stream conditions depicted on Figure 2.2-29. The significance of interconnected surface water and groundwater conditions at these areas is less than that of the two primary areas of rising groundwater, because surface water exists in these reaches much less often (Figure 2.2-12), and therefore, provides less opportunity for beneficial uses related to aquatic habitat or surface water diversions. The accuracy of the groundwater level to surface water flow correlations can be improved with the use of monitoring wells installed closer to the areas of rising groundwater

&& The Santa Clara River in the Fillmore Groundwater Basin has two reaches with rising groundwater (i.e., interconnected surface water) that correspond to the Cienega and the East Grove GDE units. Surface flows in both of these reaches are typically dominated by rising groundwater except during storm flows.

&& 
GDEs include terrestrial and aquatic habitat and other open-water aquatic habitats. There are few shallow groundwater wells (wells screened within the rooting zone of GDEs) in the Fillmore and Piru groundwater basins. In the absence of shallow wells, deeper wells, which may or may not reflect shallow groundwater conditions, coupled with observations of surface flow and ecological observations can be used to assess the extent of shallow groundwater. These data suggest that there continues to be shallow groundwater and interconnected surface water at the basin boundaries at the historical Del Valle, Cienega, and East Grove riparian woodlands (compare Figure 1.4-1 with Figure 3.1-1). The Cienega and East Grove riparian woodlands are located at sites of rising groundwater due to constrictions in the valley width. The beneficial uses of interconnected surface waters are discussed in Section 5.2.1. The role of shallow groundwater elsewhere in the basin is less certain and will be assessed based on interpolated groundwater elevation and vegetation. The GDE determination (i.e., likely or unlikely) is shown in Figure 3.1-2. 
&&
Potential GDE units in the Fillmore and Piru groundwater basins were identified based on the vegetation present and the presence of interconnected surface water. Several studies have identified the extent of reaches of the Santa Clara River that are connected to groundwater (URS 2005, Stillwater Sciences 2008, Beller et al. 2011, Beller et al. 2016). Interconnected reaches were identified as part of the GDE units. California Department of Water Resources’ (DWR) maintains an indicators of groundwater dependent ecosystems (iGDE) database. The database, which is published online and referred to as the Natural Communities Commonly Associated with Groundwater dataset (DWR 2020), includes vegetation and wetland natural communities. These data were reviewed and augmented with additional vegetation mapping datasets to produce a map of final GDE units; additional information on vegetation community composition, aerial imagery, depth to groundwater modeled from local wells (where available), plant and species distributions in the area, and plant species rooting depths were also reviewed to support this determination. Interconnected surface water was identified based on vegetation mapping (which identifies surface water), UWCD (2017), and field observations by Stillwater scientists. Maximum rooting depths from the literature are provided in Appendix C, Table C-1. Another way to explore the rooting depth of plants is to assess their elevation relative to the river channel surface (the relative elevation). Assuming that the groundwater elevation near the stream is similar to the stream elevation, we can assess the likely rooting depth of plants based on their relative elevation. Stillwater Sciences (2007a) assessed the relative elevation of various plant types in the Santa Clara River. Those results are provided in Appendix C, Table C-2.","Page 2-60 / 2.2.28; Figure 2.2-31

Below we use well data presented in the Monitoring Plan and Data Gaps Analysis Appendix (DBS&A 2020) to explore shallow groundwater trends for the GDE units shown in Figure 3.3-1 from east to west. We were unable to examine the groundwater levels in the Tributary Riparian GDE unit because there are no representative wells located in or near the  unit. used by GDEs (Table 3.1-1) and may not accurately represent the actual shallow groundwater elevation. Additionally, land surface elevation, and therefore depth to water, at a monitoring well site may differ from that at the GDEs it represents, particularly with distance from the river channel. GDEs are typically located closer to channels and at lower elevations than their representative well sites. We used a DEM to extract land surface elevations at GDEs along crosschannel transects at each well. The range of ground elevation for the GDEs is represented by the green shaded area in figures 4.1-1 through 4.1-5. In addition to depth to water data at each well site, we present the range of elevation of potential GDEs along each transect to provide rough constraints on depth to water at the potential GDEs. The following sections analyze groundwater elevation changes for some of the GDE units. In light of the limitations of the monitoring well data, the groundwater elevation data presented in this section are intended to illustrate general trends within GDE units. The spring 2019 depth to water surface (Section 2.1.2), as opposed to monitoring well data, is used to establish GDE connectivity with shallow groundwater.

Well 04N19W33D04S lies within the Cienega GDE Unit in the Fillmore Groundwater Basin and is screened at 140–486 feet (Table 4.1-1). It became operational in 1972 and the average depth to water from 1972–2019 was 5.4 feet bgs (Figure 4.1-3). The well data show significant declines during droughts, with groundwater level dropping to 25–33 feet during the droughts before returning to 5–10 ft bgs between the droughts. GDE elevations in this unit range from 2 feet above to 6 feet below the well site elevation (Figure 4.1-3).

This well has a screen depth of 120–172 feet bgs (Table 4.1-1). Over the 60 years of recorded depths to groundwater, this well averages 14.7 feet bgs (Figure 4.1-4). Similar to the other wells in the basin, the water elevation drops during droughts, with the largest drop occurring in 2016, when the water elevation was greater than 40 ft bgs. Following the droughts, the water elevation recovers to its average long-term value. GDE elevations in this unit range from 1 ft above to 12.5 ft below the well site elevation. In general, depth to water at GDEs is likely to be shallower than at the well because groundwater depths are increasing downstream toward the area of rising groundwater in the East Grove.",Page 21 && 25 && 26/ Appendix D,"1.

This determination was based on species composition and the groundwater dependency of dominant species, whether they were considered groundwater dependent by the iGDE database (DWR 2020) and wetland indicator status (Lichvar et al. 2016). Although Klausmeyer et al. (2018) includes species with upland facultative wetland indicator status (Lichvar et al. 2016) in their list of groundwater dependent mapping units, these upland facultative species were classified as unlikely to be groundwater dependent based on their typical elevation relative to the low-flow channel in the Santa Clara River watershed. Figure 2.1-4 shows the differences between the iGDE database and the potential GDE map. Section 4.1 discusses the vegetation communities that were identified as likely to depend on groundwater. These potential GDEs were overlaid with the depth to water dataset (as discussed in Section 2.1.2) in GIS and any communities occurring outside of 30-ft depth to groundwater were removed. The depth to water modeling data did not cover the entire extent of both the Fillmore and Piru groundwater basins; in these areas, a manual review of potential GDEs was performed using aerial imagery. Coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) communities were included as potential GDEs when they occurred in riparian areas or drainages; any mapped stands growing on a clear slope were excluded based on landscape position and improbable connection to groundwater.",Page 14 / Appendix D,"The plan removed GDEs based on aerial imagery of potential GDEs on clear slopes.

Die-off is considered significant and unreasonable because the GDE units do not fully recover following recovery of groundwater levels, except until after the next major storm occurs to scour away debris and provide new habitat for recolonization (i.e., germination of seeds).&&&
3.2.3 Cause of Groundwater Conditions that Would Lead to Undesirable
 Results (Reg. § 354.26[b][1])  Two primary causes of groundwater conditions that would lead to undesirable results are considered (1) climate variability and (2) groundwater pumping. Less precipitation (inflow) and more pumping (outflow) generally results in lower groundwater levels. A third and likely less significant cause of groundwater conditions that would lead to undesirable results is the presence of invasive species (e.g., Arundo donax), which are thought to use a higher amount of groundwater (via ET) than other native vegetation (e.g., GDEs), and also preclude the presence of native GDEs (i.e., beneficial uses). These causes of groundwater level changes (i.e., declines) can extend to any of the applicable undesirable results.&&&
The Agency deliberated extensively to determine if undesirable results related to the depletion of interconnected surface water, namely loss of Steelhead rearing and spawning habitat along the Santa Clara River as a sustainability indicator, is a significant and unreasonable effect of groundwater conditions. Ultimately, the Agency does not consider this a significant and unreasonable effect related to depletions of interconnected surface water because: (1) there is no designated existing or potential beneficial use for spawning and rearing along the Santa Clara River in the Basin per the LARWQCB Basin Plan (LARWQCB, 1994); (2) there is no evidence of these fish using the surface water (except during major flood events when the Santa Clara River is fully connected with runoff); and (3) even severe (i.e., 50%) pumping reductions would not prevent the surface water at Cienega Riparian Complex from going dry during severe droughts.&&&
3.3.1.2 GDE Die-Off due to Declining Water Levels from Implementation of the GSP Concerns about the effect of groundwater level declines during droughts on GDEs in the rising groundwater areas were recognized by the FPBGSA Directors and additional analyses were performed to quantify the impact groundwater extractions had on water levels in the vicinity of the major GDE areas (Cienega/Fish Hatchery area near Fillmore-Piru basin boundary and East End/Willard Road area of the Fillmore basin near the Fillmore-Santa Paula boundary) along the Santa Clara River. The shallow groundwater, as well as the surface water, in both of these GDE areas is fed by rising groundwater. A third area of GDEs fed by shallow groundwater and/or surface water is the Del Valle area in eastern Piru basin. This area has relatively stable surface water flows and shallow groundwater levels due to the waste water treatment plant effluent from the Valencia treatment plant being discharged to the Santa Clara River. In the absence of declining water levels and a relatively stable supply of effluent, this GDE area will not be considered further in this section. Shallow groundwater levels are known to vary in the areas with the GDEs in accordance with the major precipitation trends – lower water levels during periods of drought with higher levels associated with wet to normal precipitation patterns. It is also recognized that the ongoing groundwater extraction activity also impacts water levels. A GSA is not responsible for mitigating the impacts of a drought on water levels, but it is important for the FPBGSA to understand the degree to which groundwater extractions contribute to lower groundwater levels reported during major droughts. The impact of groundwater extractions on water levels near the Santa Clara River were evaluated by comparing simulated water levels from two model scenarios: ⦁ Current pumping practices (i.e., extraction quantities, spatial distribution of wells); and ⦁ A hypothetical 50% reduction in pumping achieved by eliminating groundwater extractions from wells within about 1 mile of the Santa Clara River (Figure 3-4).

If/when this MT is exceeded, mitigation (Section 4) will be implemented to offset the undesirable result that would occur without adequate soil moisture. It is important to note that the concept of this mitigation program is not expected to restore groundwater levels above the MT (because it is believed this would require an unreasonable amount of supplemental water), but more importantly, provide assurance that adequate soil moisture is sustained in the vadose/root zone of the GDEs to prevent dieoff (i.e., prevent an undesirable result) related to groundwater level declines.&&&

The TM subsection identifies several potential locations for installation of new shallow Zone A monitoring wells and a nested (multi-depth monitoring facility) site. Proposed new shallow (i.e., Zone A) monitoring wells are shown on Figure 6-1 in Appendix K (DBS&A, 2021a) (the figure was not reproduced in the GSP). These are represented as blue circles on the map and are labeled numerically by suggested priority (i.e., “1” is the highest priority and “7” is the lowest). These new wells, coupled with existing Zone A wells, currently monitored by UWCD will enhance the FPBGSA’s monitoring program by yielding groundwater level and quality data for evaluation of sustainability of the water resources of this uppermost aquifer zone in the Fillmore and Piru Basins. The proposed new Zone A monitor wells will also improve the assessment of the extent of interconnected surface water. Further discussion on the new monitoring wells is included in Section 4 As mentioned in GSP subsection 3.5.4.1, UWCD expanded its water level monitoring program list in 2020 to include an additional existing privately owned well in the Fillmore Basin. The effort resulted in successfully filling a monitoring network data gap using an existing well in the Basin instead of drilling a new monitoring. As a result, one fewer new monitoring wells is needed to fill FPBGSA monitoring network data gaps as were originally proposed.

The grant funds will be used to install three new shallow monitoring wells at locations that will be identified in consultation with CDFW and the restoration team.

For example, NDVI would be expected to initially decline following the large floods that tend to uproot vegetation and provide fresh bare mineral surfaces and appropriate hydrological conditions for seedling establishment of cottonwoods and willows, but then increase again as native cottonwood and willow vegetation becomes established and individual shrubs and trees develop and mature. Groundwater wells near the basin boundaries (the Del Valle, Cienega, and East Grove GDE units) can be used to determine changes in groundwater levels. Such data on groundwater levels through time could then be examined to see if there are clear correlations with observed trends in NDVI or related indicators of GDE health.

The primary action being considered by the FPBGSA is to provide supplemental groundwater to the restoration program during multi year droughts when the shallow groundwater levels decline to below the Critical Water Level. The groundwater would be supplied from an existing production well (if a suitable well can be found or alternatively a newly constructed well) that is extracting water from the deeper hydrostratigraphic units (i.e., not the shallow aquifers). CDFW and the restoration management team would use the water in the manner they deem most beneficial to their restoration program. The mitigative effects of this action include: • Providing a refuge for vegetation and wildlife during a period of prolonged drought; • Supplying water that can be used to irrigate additional land parcels that are not served by the effluent from the fish hatchery operations; • Providing a natural seed supply that will be important for revegetation efforts in post drought time frame; and • Possible use as a seed source area for a “seed bank” that can function as a repository for native vegetation seeds for use in future restoration programs. Monitoring the depth of the shallow groundwater near this GDE area is an important component of this project. The FPBGSA recognized the lack of shallow aquifer groundwater level data in this area as a data gap and has proposed the installation of three monitoring wells to serve as the reference wells for this project. The monitoring wells are further described in another project. Details of how this project would be implemented have not yet been developed.

Periods of vegetation die-off in the GDE areas associated with a prolonged series of drought years creates opportunities for plants such as arundo and tamarisk to aggressively colonize areas impacted by the die-off. The FPBGSA will evaluate the cost – benefit relationship of a non-native vegetation removal program as integrated into other entities vegetation removal activities. Prior high-level cost estimates of arundo removal (Bell et al., 2016) vary depending on the density of arundo per acre (e.g., from as low as $5,500 per acre for high density areas that can be efficiently removed with heavy machinery up to the range of $24,500 to $44,250 per acre for moderate and low density areas, respectively, which require more manual labor to treat localized occurrences).

The program would likely focus on providing financial or in-kind services to assist other entities engaged in the removal of non-native vegetation species that are intensive water users. Periods of vegetation die-off in the GDE areas associated with a prolonged series of drought years creates opportunities for plants such as arundo and tamarisk to aggressively colonize areas impacted by the die-off. The FPBGSA will evaluate the cost – benefit relationship of a non-native vegetation removal program as integrated into other entities vegetation removal activities. Prior high-level cost estimates of arundo removal (Bell et al., 2016) vary depending on the density of arundo per acre (e.g., from as low as $5,500 per acre for high density areas that can be efficiently removed with heavy machinery up to the range of $24,500 to $44,250 per acre for moderate and low density areas, respectively, which require more manual labor to treat localized occurrences). Effective (i.e., long-lasting) removal of arundo for the Basin would likely require coordination with upper Watershed (i.e., Santa Clarita) to remove all sources of the arundo that would otherwise likely transport and recolonize down river in the Basin). The non-native vegetation removal program, if deemed appropriate by the FPBGSA, will be include the preparation of an implementation and funding plan by the FPBGSA prior to the five year update to the GS&&&
The FPBGSA desires to dampen the impacts of groundwater extraction by supporting the restoration efforts at the Cienega Restoration Project. The primary action being considered by the FPBGSA is to provide supplemental groundwater to the restoration program during multi year droughts when the shallow groundwater levels decline to below the Critical Water Level. The groundwater would be supplied from an existing production well (if a suitable well can be found or alternatively a newly constructed well) that is extracting water from the deeper hydrostratigraphic units (i.e., not the shallow aquifers). CDFW and the restoration management team would use the water in the manner they deem most beneficial to their restoration program. The mitigative effects of this action include: • Providing a refuge for vegetation and wildlife during a period of prolonged drought; • Supplying water that can be used to irrigate additional land parcels that are not served by the effluent from the fish hatchery operations; • Providing a natural seed supply that will be important for revegetation efforts in post drought time frame; and • Possible use as a seed source area for a “seed bank” that can function as a repository for native vegetation seeds for use in future restoration programs. Monitoring the depth of the shallow groundwater near this GDE area is an important component of this project. The FPBGSA recognized the lack of shallow aquifer groundwater level data in this area as a data gap and has proposed the installation of three monitoring wells to serve as the reference wells for this project. The monitoring wells are further described in another project. Details of how this project would be implemented have not yet been developed. FPBGSA staff have engaged with CDFW representatives about this project and the conversations are continuing. A detailed Mitigation Plan will be developed after the GSP has been adopted by the FPBGSA and the GSP submitted to DWR for their review (Jan 2022)","4-5 / 4.6

The FPBGSA will consider augmenting the water quality network in the vicinity of Pole Creek Fan. This area was identified (Appendix K) as having limited water quality information on analytes that are near a regulatory threshold. If additional water quality sampling is deemed appropriate by the FPBGSA, a detailed monitoring program outlining which wells would be sampled, the sampling frequency, and the suite of analytes will be prepared and implemented by the FPBGSA prior to the five year update to the GSP. The FPBGSA would need to identify who is going to collect these additional samples (e.g., FPBGSA staff, consultant) and develop a funding source for these activities. Water quality regulatory authorities do not fall into the purview of FPBGSA, but the agency is committed to monitoring the water quality and working with the appropriate entity that does have regulatory authority to address any concerns identified in the future.

The FPBGSA will consider establishing a discretionary fund that will be used to purchase supplemental waters when they are available. The amount of these waters that become available will vary from year to year with little or no water available most years. A likely source of supplemental water could come from UWCD’s Table A allocation and the opportunity that allocation affords UWCD to purchase Article 21 waters. In the past, UWCD has used their funds to purchase Article 21 waters and deliver them via the Santa Clara River to downstream users. A significant portion of the waters infiltrate in the Fillmore and Piru basins thus increasing the water levels and groundwater storage.","Page 4-2 / 4.1

Climate conditions are considered to have a more significant impact on surface water flows than groundwater pumping.
