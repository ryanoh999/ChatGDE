There have been some one-off samples collected and tested over the years, but there is no long-term groundwater quality record in any municipal monitoring well. There are longer groundwater quality records in monitoring wells associated with contamination cleanup sites. These only provide data for the period during active site assessment and remediation. Many of these monitoring wells are destroyed once clean up goals have been achieved. Private domestic use wells are not subject to DDW drinking water regulations. However, the County requires one-time testing of nitrate, TDS, chloride, iron, and manganese for any new private well. Small water systems that supply groundwater to 15 – 199 service connections also report water quality to the County. These water quality constituents include inorganics, nitrates, arsenic, perchlorate, chromium, radiation, synthetic organic compounds, VOCs, and fuel oxygenates, which include MTBE. The frequency of monitoring ranges between 1 year and 9 years depending on the constituents. Smaller water systems with between 5 and 14 service connections have limited one-time testing requirements for inorganics and report quarterly bacteriologic water quality to the County.

&&

 TDS: Santa Cruz County enforces the 1,000 mg/L upper limit of the secondary MCL. TDS concentrations in portions of the Santa Margarita aquifer are generally low as a result of its high permeability, exposure at the surface, and associated high rate of aquifer “flushing” (Johnson, 2006; Johnson, 2009). In areas where wells pump from the Santa Margarita aquifer and data on TDS concentrations are available, the following observations on Santa Margarita aquifer TDS are made:
• Quail Hollow has relatively low TDS concentrations typically below 150 mg/L (Figure 2-53)
• The Olympia area has higher TDS concentrations typically ranging between 200 and 600 mg/L (Figure 2-53)
• Historical TDS concentrations in Santa Margarita aquifer wells in the Pasatiempo/Camp Evers/southern Scotts Valley area were lower and more stable than TDS concentrations in the Olympia wells (Johnson, 2009). Since the Santa Margarita aquifer is no longer pumped by municipal suppliers in the Pasatiempo/Camp Evers/southern Scotts Valley area there is no current testing of groundwater quality to determine if this is still the case.

&&

There are very few wells screened in the Monterey Formation that have groundwater quality data. SVWD’s Well #9, the only Monterey Formation well in the Basin with long-term and recent groundwater quality data, has TDS concentrations ranging from 300 to 1,430 mg/L (Figure 2-54). Together with 2 Lompico aquifer wells (SVWD #10A and SLVWD Pasatiempo #7), SVWD’s Well #9 has an increasing TDS trend. It is thought its increased TDS concentration is linked to the dewatered Santa Margarita aquifer in the area that has caused reduced leakage of good quality water to the underlying aquifers (Johnson, 2009). High TDS concentrations appear to correspond to periods when the well was being pumped more and thereby extracting a greater proportion of its groundwater from deeper in the Monterey Formation which is known to have elevated TDS because of its marine origin and more limited flushing. This well is no longer used by SVWD for water supply because of its low yield and poor water quality

&&

Iron and Manganese: As with TDS, previous analysis has noted generally lower iron and manganese in some areas of the Santa Margarita aquifer as a result of high rates of aquifer “flushing” (Johnson, 2009; Johnson, 2016). Concentrations in these areas are consistently below state secondary MCLs including frequent non-detects (Figure 2-57 and Figure 2-58). However, iron and manganese concentrations above respective secondary MCLs do occur in other areas of the Santa Margarita aquifer, such as in the Olympia area, where concentrations of iron and manganese can be as high as 1.5 mg/L and 0.33 mg/L, respectively. Figure 2-59 shows iron and manganese concentrations for extraction well SLVWD Olympia #2 versus its groundwater elevations. Over the period of record, there have been both decreases and increases in manganese concentrations, none of which appear related to changing groundwater elevations. Iron concentrations do not follow the same trend as manganese and generally remain below the secondary MCL, but they do periodically and temporarily increase above the secondary MCL. For the most part, changes in iron concentrations do not appear to be influenced by changing groundwater elevations, although the historically low groundwater elevation for this well in WY2016 did correspond to 2 samples above the secondary MCL during that year (Figure 2-59).

&&

Arsenic: Arsenic concentrations above the MCL (up to 0.025 mg/L) are found periodically in wells pumping from the Lompico aquifer (Figure 2-64). Due to wells with groundwater quality data in the Lompico aquifer being limited to wells in the Pasatiempo and Scotts Valley portions of the Basin (Figure 2-66), there are no arsenic data for the Lompico aquifer in other portions of the Basin. Non-detect or low detections of arsenic in the Basin’s other aquifers (all wells with data are included in Appendix 2C), including the Butano aquifer support the observation that elevated arsenic is limited to the Lompico aquifer.&&&&
NItrate: Maximum nitrate (as N) detections in municipal wells from 2010 to 2020 were 3.6 mg/L in the Santa Margarita aquifer, and 0.7 mg/L in the Lompico aquifer which are below the nitrate (as N) MCL of 10 mg/L. Nitrate concentrations are generally higher in the permeable Santa Margarita aquifer due to its widespread exposure at the surface and proximity to potential nitrate contamination sources such as septic tanks and livestock/stables. The description of nitrate concentrations below is limited to areas where groundwater quality data are available. Figure 2-68 plots nitrate (as N) concentrations in SLVWD Quail Hollow extraction wells from 1970-2020.

&&

Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, are detected at low levels in the Basin’s surface water and groundwater. CEC pathways to surface and groundwater resources are similar to nitrate since these constituents are typically found in wastewater. New and emerging contaminants are currently unregulated but may be subject to future regulation. Examples of new and emerging contaminants are N-Nitrosodimethylamine, and 1,4-dioxane, disinfection byproducts, and perfluorinated substances.","pg 2-144, 2.2.5.4.2

It has been noted that Bean Creek, beginning about a mile downstream of Mackenzie Creek, typically goes dry in the summer and has done so since the 1960s, although the extents vary between years (Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, 2015b; personal communication with John Ricker, March 2020). Balance Hydrologics conducted a stream walk along the dry reach to document the conditions and extent during October 2019 and July 2020 (Neill and Hecht, 2020, Neill et al., 2021). The greatest increases in flows were observed downstream of the confluence of Ruins Creek with Bean Creek. This reach, in particular, is the primary gaining reach within the Basin and is characterized by areas where the stream has cut through the Santa Margarita sandstone and into the top of underlying Monterey shale, such that springs in the streambed and along the sides of the stream are contributing groundwater discharge (Figure 2-72). Balance Hydrologics conducted a stream walk along the lower Bean Creek reach in September of 2020 to document the numerous seeps and springs contributing groundwater from the Santa Margarita aquifer (Neill et al., 2021). Similar observations of seeps and springs contributing groundwater along streams within the Basin have been documented along the San Lorenzo River, Zayante Creek, and Eagle Creek (Parke and Hecht, 2020a; Parke and Hecht, 2020b). 

&& In addition to accretion studies and field observations, a comparison of groundwater elevations in monitoring wells to nearby streambed elevations shows static groundwater levels consistently higher than the streambed, indicating that groundwater is contributing to streamflow in these locations year-round. For example, Figures 3-8 and 3-9 in Section 3.7.2 compare elevations in monitoring well SLVWD Quail MW-A with nearby streambed elevations in Zayante Creek and in monitoring well SV4-MW with nearby streambed elevations in Bean Creek, respectively. Findings from these studies and observations are combined with model-simulated groundwater elevations in relation to creeks and land surface to produce a map of where surface water and groundwater are connected (Figure 2-72). The map includes creek connections together with non-riparian areas where depth to groundwater is on average less than 30 feet.

Areas of the Basin that are  lacking these types of data are those that are outside of the jurisdiction of SLVWD, SVWD, and MHA where private domestic groundwater extraction takes place. Additionally, the deep Butano aquifer is poorly understood because it only has 2 dedicated monitoring wells. These data gaps have led to some uncertainty on how the aquifers interact with each other in parts of the Basin and respond to change in fluxes, such as recharge and groundwater extraction.

Evapotranspiration projections are stable despite lower precipitation mainly because temperature is anticipated to increase during the projected period.

The climate change scenario used for the predictive scenarios differs from CMIP5 Mod in that a warming trend is enforced. Temperature is assigned on an annual basis based on whether the average annual temperature for all samples is below (cooler) or above (warmer) the average annual temperature for the entire projection period. For the cooler years, the sample representing the 50th percentile of annual temperature is used. For the warmer years, the sample representing the 99th percentile of annual temperature is used.

Surface water inflows and outflows during the projected period decrease by about 9%, in comparison to the historical period, which reflects drier climatic conditions predicted in the future. Surface water and groundwater interaction reflected as discharge to creeks and streambed recharge to groundwater fluctuates proportionally with precipitation and surface water inflow, especially during periods of extended drought. Consequently, the amount of surface water and groundwater interaction decreases during the projected period.

EKI’s recommendation 10 to include down-scaled climate change in projected hydrology is based on GSP regulation requirements for the GSP’s projected water budget to incorporate projected climate change over the planning and   implementation horizon. It also follows that model evaluation of expected benefits of projects and management actions over the planning and implementation horizon should also incorporate projected climate change. Projected climate
change has been incorporated into the predictive simulations as described below. 
. . .
While DWR’s datasets are based on a climate period approach that incorporates the effects of climate change based on projected change from historical conditions to a specific future period (e.g. 2030 or 2070), transient climate change analysis evaluates the change of effects of climate change progressing over time (e.g., simulating the increasing effects of climate change from 2020 to 2070). Table 4 shows the local models and data that have previously been developed in the Basin’s watershed and region.

A transient analysis is appropriate to represent inter-annual variability of precipitation that is indicated by recent research (Swain et al., 2018).

As described by Balance (2020), precipitation is assigned on an annual basis based on whether the average annual rainfall for all samples is below (dry) or above (wet) the average annual rainfall for the entire projection period. For dry years, the sample representing the 10th percentile of annual rainfall is  used. For wet years, the sample representing the 75th percentile of annualrainfall is used. The following plots label the climate change scenario used for the Santa Margarita basin model predictive scenarios as “Four Model Ensemble 50-99.” Figure 51 shows the annual variability in precipitation for the Four Model Ensemble 50-99 compared to Climate Catalog used for the Santa Cruz Mid-County GSP, GFDL2.1 from the CMIP3 global circulation model ensemble used for the City of Santa Cruz Water Supply Advisory Committee, and GFDL CM3 from the more current CMIP5 ensemble. As designed, the annual variability in precipitation for the Four Model Ensemble 50-99 is greater than the other 3 scenarios. Figure 52 shows the cumulative departure from historical mean for Four Model Ensemble 50-99 compared to the historical mean.

Yes: Sustainable yield is calculated based on projected water budget with climate change (ranges based on different future scenarios is OK)","sustainable yield, projected water budget",Yes,"Basin-wide groundwater pumping within the sustainable yield does not constitute proof of sustainability. Sustainability under SGMA is only demonstrated by avoiding undesirable results or the sustainability indicators applicable to the Basin. Specific undesirable results for the chronic lowering of groundwater levels, reduction in groundwater storage, and depletion of interconnected surface water sustainability indicators are presented in Section 3. While GSP Regulations only require 1 sustainable yield volume for the entire basin, pumping within the sustainable yield may affect groundwater elevations in different aquifers and aquifer subareas differently depending on how pumping is distributed spatially. Therefore, sustainable yield volumes are estimated for each aquifer based on predictive model simulations that do not produce undesirable results. The future baseline model simulation incorporating climate change and projected water use predicts undesirable results will not occur within the modeled 50-year interval. This means that groundwater pumping volumes used in the baseline simulation can be used to estimate sustainable yield. Given that groundwater pumping in the model is not specifically optimized to avoid undesirable results, it is possible that slightly more pumping than the estimated sustainable yield could avoid future undesirable results. Groundwater pumping in the projected baseline simulation, shown on Figure 2-91, is generally consistent after WY2022 in the Monterey Formation, and Lompico and Butano aquifers. The sustainable yield for those aquifers is therefore set as the average pumping after 2022 plus a 5% buffer to allow for pumping optimization during GSP implementation.

WQ,SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT CRITERIA,Undesirable Results,Domestic,1,Does the GSP analyze direct or indirect impacts on domestic drinking wells when defining Undesirable Results for 1) Chronic Lowering of Groundwater Levels and 2) Water Quality (See line 24)?,"NO: no mention Somewhat: explicit mention of drinking water users, but not well analyzed; mention impact on one of the UR, mentioning some of the COCs. YES: clear impact on drinking water users & explanation of all COCs","domestic well, drinking water, undesirable result, groundwater levels, water quality, groundwater quality",Somewhat,"The County has records that many shallow private wells less than 100 feet in depth outside of the Scotts Valley area were deepened or replaced in response to declining groundwater levels towards the end of the Water Year (WY) 1987-1994 drought. Since that extended drought there have not been many wells deepened or replaced with deeper wells, including during the WY2012-2015 drought.
Lowering of groundwater levels in the Santa Margarita aquifer in years of drought, although not ideal, are not considered significant and unreasonable if levels can recover (either naturally, by managed recharge, or by reducing pumping). It is anticipated that climate change will cause wetter wet years and drier dry years. Multiple consecutive dry years may lead to groundwater levels falling below historical measured lows (i.e., minimum thresholds). Groundwater model simulations under projected climate conditions demonstrate the effects of climate extremes on groundwater levels, including that during wet years, the Santa Margarita aquifer fills up relatively quickly because of its high recharge rate.$$$ 
Rural residential land uses and users. Typically, rural residential users have the shallowest wells which makes them more vulnerable to lowered groundwater levels. If groundwater levels decline below the top of well screens or below pump intakes, landowners may lose access to groundwater and be forced to lower their pumps or drill their well deeper. Additionally, when groundwater levels fall below the top of well screens, this has the potential to cause cascading water in the well. Cascading or falling water is water flowing through preferential pathways above the groundwater table that falls into the well. As it pours into the well it introduces air into the water being pumped thereby causing pump cavitation. This condition may increase the cost to pump, cause physical damage to the well and pump, and potentially degrade
groundwater quality within the well due to microbial biofouling. Property values may decline if low groundwater levels cause undesirable results that require residential pumping restrictions, deepening of wells, or connection to a public water system. Some small water systems rely on springs and lowered groundwater levels may dry the springs out.

&&
Rural residential land uses and users. Since private well owners do not routinely test groundwater pumped by their wells, there is a strong possibility that they could unknowingly drink groundwater exceeding drinking water standards and experience potential health effects. In addition, not having access to groundwater as a water source because of known undesirable results will significantly devalue properties that have no alternative water source or cannot be connected to a municipal water system. Finally, costly treatment systems may need to be installed depending on the concentration and chemical found in rural water supplies.
The following are conditions that do not cause undesirable results as defined in this GSP:
1. It is not considered an undesirable result if activities by private individuals or companies mobilize poor quality groundwater or introduce poor quality water or contaminants into the Basin. 
2. Naturally elevated concentrations already exceeding minimum thresholds are not considered an undesirable result because it was not caused by the SMGWA member or  cooperating agencies. Examples of elevated naturally occurring chemical constituents in the Basin are iron, manganese, sulfate, and arsenic. These constituents are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2.4.4.3. 
3. Nitrates introduced into the Santa Margarita aquifer and surface water through wastewater disposal, livestock, fertilizer use, and other sources have been occurring since the lands within the Basin were first developed. County of Santa Cruz Environmental Health is responsible for improving septic tank standards and has been implementing the San Lorenzo Nitrate Management Plan since 1995 to reduce nitrate impacts in the Basin. Since nitrate impacts have been occurring for decades, SMGWA is not responsible for causing them not mitigating them.&&&& Minimum thresholds for COCs in degraded groundwater quality RMPs are state drinking water standards, with the exception of nitrate (as N). Using state standards to define minimum thresholds is consistent with the SMGWA defined significant and unreasonable water quality degradation that results in adverse impacts including materially diminished water supplies or undue costs for mitigating such negative impacts. Federal, state, or local regulatory requirements are established after careful scientific study, legal review and procedural steps mandated by law. They are designed to protect public health and welfare, and they provide the clearest indication of the point beyond which there is a real risk of an undesirable result (Moran and Belin, 2019). Nitrate (as N) concentrations in groundwater are typically less than 5 mg/L. Because nitrate in groundwater influences nitrate concentrations in the San Lorenzo River (described in Section 2.1.2.3), allowing nitrate concentrations in groundwater to increase above 5 mg/L will make it challenging to meet the San Lorenzo River’s 0.33 mg/L nitrate total maximum daily load (TMDL) enforced by the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).

Ecological land uses and users. GDEs have the potential to be impacted directly if the depth to groundwater exceeds depths accessed by the roots of groundwater dependent vegetation. Surface water bodies connected to groundwater may also incur reductions in baseflow. Under late summer low flow conditions, there is a direct relationship between streamflow and the amount of suitable GDE habitat. Reduction of flow directly reduces the amount of suitable rearing habitat for steelhead, by reducing the amount of wetted area, stream depth, flow velocity, cover, and dissolved oxygen. Reduced flow can also result in increased water temperature. In extreme conditions, dewatering of stream reaches eliminates the ability of fish to move to more suitable areas and can cause mortality. In even more extreme conditions, lowering of groundwater levels below the root zone of riparian vegetation can result in the loss of vegetation, impacting terrestrial GDE habitat.","47 / 2.1.3.4.9

A minimum threshold of 5 mg/L is established for nitrate (as N) because:

2. The groundwater quality goal is to prevent concentrations from worsening and concentrations above 5 mg/L are currently uncommon throughout the Basin

A project of this nature would only be considered if it were found that private pumping was impacting surface water sources, if there was concern about shallower private wells going dry, or if there are climate change impacts not accounted for in current models. If this were the case, some parcels or developments could choose to be connected to the nearest public water system. Preliminary analysis undertaken as part of GSP development using the groundwater model indicates that private pumping is not causing significant depletion of interconnected surface water and so this is not a necessary project. Additionally, connecting rural parcels to a water system will require significant additional infrastructure for minimal benefit given the size and relatively low population density of the region.


Under such a curtailment scenario, the SMGWA would determine the amount of water that affected groundwater beneficial users could
pump sustainably, and the pumpers would be required to reduce their groundwater extraction to that allocation. All pumpers subject to allocations and restriction would be required to be metered. Should this dire option need to be considered at some point in the future, considerable technical work, discussion, and stakeholder input would be needed for the SMGWA to define the policies and procedures required to implement groundwater pumping restrictions.",46 / 4.6.4,"1.

• Changes to Basin Pumping. If the location and rates of groundwater pumping change as a result of projects implemented or management actions taken under the GSP, these changes could alter hydraulic gradients and cause movement of existing poor-quality groundwater towards a supply well at concentrations that exceed minimum thresholds.
• Groundwater Recharge. Active groundwater recharge through injection wells or surface spreading could potentially modify groundwater gradients and move existing poor-quality groundwater towards a supply well in concentrations that exceed minimum thresholds. Another potential cause of groundwater degradation from recharge by injecting water into the aquifer is mobilization of metals. Introducing surface water or purified wastewater into an aquifer may change the eH or pH of groundwater in such a way that minerals in the aquifer such as pyrite break down or trace elements are desorbed from clays, thereby releasing iron, manganese, or arsenic into the groundwater. Pilot testing can help understand geochemical impacts an ASR project may or may not have before a decision can be made on its feasibility.
• Recharge of Poor-Quality Water. A SMGWA approved recharge project could introduce poor quality water or contaminants into the Basin. This is highly unlikely because of the state’s antidegradation policy that prevents projects from causing degradation of surface water or groundwater.

SMGWA approved projects and management activities may potentially degrade surface water quality under the following conditions:
• Degraded Groundwater Impacts to Surface Water: Groundwater in the Basin is highly connected to surface water which means the quality of groundwater influences the quality of surface water. This is evident in the elevated nitrate concentrations in the San Lorenzo River influenced in large part by septic system leaching to groundwater. Users of surface water within the Basin are primarily SLVWD, and to a lesser extent a few private users and small water systems who have water rights. Surface water from the Basin is also used outside of the Basin by the City of Santa Cruz that has appropriative rights to San Lorenzo River water via licenses. These licenses allow the withdrawal of water at the San Lorenzo River Intake in Santa Cruz for delivery to the Graham Hill water treatment plant and the Felton diversion for storage at Loch Lomond Reservoir. Surface water is always treated before being used by the City of Santa Cruz for potable water. If SMGWA approved projects and management activities degrade surface water quality, additional treatment may be needed depending on the chemical constituents and concentrations.
• Degraded Groundwater Impacts to Soil Vapor: If SMGWA approved projects or management actions move existing plumes with vapor-forming chemicals, a potential impact on urban land use is formation of soil vapor plumes that may impact health. Vapor intrusion occurs when vapor-forming chemicals in contaminated soils or groundwater migrate into overlying buildings. Vapor-forming chemicals may include VOCs, such as TCE and benzene, select semi-volatile organic compounds, such as naphthalene, elemental mercury, and some polychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides (USEPA, 2020).",3-71 - 3-72,"1.

The management action outlines a multi-pronged approach that increases awareness about indoor and outdoor water use efficiencies, promotes water efficient behaviors, and continuously reduces water waste. The program components include additional education and outreach measures such as free house calls to provide consultation and devices for efficient water use, continued participation in countywide conservation coalition activities, continued public speaking and local media placements, irrigation scheduling guidelines, commercial kitchen pre-rinse spray valve project repeating in 5 years (2023), and community outreach at Scotts Valley and Felton Farmers Market and other events.

In addition, SVWD will evaluate feasibility and effectiveness of a program that sets water targets for landscape customers. While education and outreach programs increase awareness and efficiency on the customer side, both SLWVD and SVWD will look to continue to increase efficiencies within their respective distribution systems through improvements to the metering infrastructure, evaluation and remediation of non-revenue water, and system pressure reduction. New metering infrastructures allow for increased accuracy, leak detection, and customer involvement and awareness.

Advanced treated wastewater would be injected into the Lompico aquifer in the Scotts Valley area. The project could use the expanded capacity of Soquel Creek Water District’s (SqCWD) Chanticleer Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) that is scheduled to begin construction in 2021 as part of the Pure Water Soquel project. SVWD is in the process of assessing the feasibility and benefit to the Basin of using purified wastewater to replenish the Lompico aquifer. In 2020, SVWD performed an alternatives analysis to assess alternative purified wastewater projects ranging between 250 to 2,600 AFY (Kennedy/Jenks, 2020). Modeling performed in preparation of this GSP shows 710 AFY of replenishment would be enough to raise groundwater levels in the Lompico aquifer by 20 to 80 feet (see Section 4.5.6 for results) and meet measurable objectives. Preliminary modeling results indicate that if the expanded conjunctive use project with Loch Lomond (Phase 1 and 2) is not implemented, recharge of purified wastewater in excess of 710 AFY will create drought storage
that can be used while still meeting measurable objectives. To generate 710 AFY of purified wastewater, Pure Water Soquel Chanticleer AWPF would require a partial expansion, while full expansion of the Pure Water Soquel Chanticleer AWPF would generate 1,500 AFY of purified wastewater. In both the 710 and 1,500 AFY alternatives, secondary-treated effluent would be conveyed to the Chanticleer AWPF via planned infrastructure as part of the Pure Water Soquel project. Secondary-treated effluent would be treated using micro-filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light and advanced oxidation process.

After recharging enough purified wastewater to increase groundwater levels to measurable objectives, any additional water stored in the aquifer may be used to augment groundwater or surface water providing a drought resilient supply that will increase the cooperating agencies’ water supply resiliency.
The groundwater model was used to simulate groundwater conditions in the Basin in response to injecting 710 AFY in the central and northern Scotts Valley area. The Basin groundwater budget and groundwater levels for the project simulation are compared against a baseline “no project” simulation. Both the project and baseline simulations account for projected climate change described in Appendix 2D. A project of greater capacity was not modeled.
Table 4-5 compares the Basin groundwater budgets for baseline conditions with injecting 710 AFY of purified wastewater into the Lompico aquifer. The project is simulated to have the following benefits to the Basin:
• 200 AFY more groundwater is left in storage
• 300 AFY more net groundwater discharge to creeks as baseflow
Compared to 540 AFY conjunctive use (Section 4.3.6, Table 4-1), the amount of groundwater discharge to creeks from 710 AFY purified wastewater recharge (Table 4-5) is very similar, but there is 75% more groundwater in storage because of direct injection into the Lompico aquifer.
Like the expanded conjunctive use with Loch Lomond project, groundwater storage losses for the 710 AFY purified wastewater injection simulation is mostly in the Santa Margarita aquifer due to reduced precipitation in the climate change projection used in the simulations (Table 4-6).",4-39 / 4.5.6,,

The minimum thresholds are derived from a projected baseline model simulation incorporating climate change and projected pumping that predicts undesirable results will not occur over the GSP planning and implementation horizon of 50 years. Groundwater pumping volumes from the baseline simulation are used to estimate sustainable yield and represent minimum thresholds. For all aquifers apart from the Santa Margarita aquifer the long-term period from WY2022-2072
produces relatively constant groundwater in storage, therefore the long-term average pumping over this period is used for the minimum threshold calculation. While change of groundwater in storage in the Santa Margarita aquifer is more variable, groundwater pumping in this aquifer produces near zero cumulative groundwater in storage loss from WY2030-2049, therefore this period is used for the minimum threshold calculation. Given that groundwater pumping in the model is not specifically optimized to avoid undesirable results, it is possible that slightly more pumping than the estimated sustainable yield could avoid future undesirable results. A 5 percent buffer to account for this is added to all minimum threshold calculations to allow for pumping optimization during GSP implementation.
