,,,"SH: Tribes are not present within the basin. This plan is very similar to Santa Rosa and Petaluma, all need to include a seperate domestic well map instead of mapping all water wells in one map. Also need more clarification on stakeholder representation on the advisory board. 
ISW: decent analysis but lack of temporal data; final ISW map does not describe gaining vs. losing stream segments; surface water in the southeastern area of basin is not included as ISW and unsure the reasoning for this; data gaps identiifed in monitoring network section
GDE: flora and fauna are briefly described; critical species acknolwedged; lack of spatial and temporal description of groundwater data; unsure which GDEs were removed based on description and figure
CC: Used numerical model with RCP 8.5 and HadGEM2-ES GCM to incorporate precip, ET (not native veg), surface flows (not imports), and sea level rise into projected budget. Projected SY based on projected conditions with CC incorporated.
SMC: They have done a decent job, they are still missing details and have data gaps regarding ISW and GDE.
PMA: They don't have many plans, but they did a good job explaining what their projects, however more details are needed for benefits to beneficial users.
Other: No mention of OpenET; vague reference to metering (beyond existing programs); passing mention of new water market. PMAs addressed demand reduction and supply augmentation through planned projects. Coordination with RWQCB discussed.",,,,GSP ID,30,,,

7.2.2 Communication and Stakeholder Engagement
The GSA will continue the communication and stakeholder activities described in Section 1, including: • Approach and engage a diverse set of stakeholders and groundwater users by reaching out to and meeting with organizations that represent disadvantaged communities, farmers, environmental interests, rural landowners, and business interests.

&&

Engaging Disadvantaged Communities – Community Events and Existing Venues Disadvantaged communities (DACs) are specifically called out in SGMA as an interested party. Eighty-one percent of the area in the Sonoma Valley Basin is designated an Economically Distressed Area, and eight percent of the area in the Basin (Temelec, Agua Caliente and The Springs areas) is categorized as a Disadvantaged Community. A large percent of the people living in the DAC areas of Sonoma Valley are Spanish speaking, and many are relatively recent immigrants. Previous assessments of engaging Sonoma County’s Spanish speaking community recommend using “food, faith and festivals” as opportunities to educate and interact with people on critical issues. Connecting with communities through existing organizations, like La Luz, and through community events, churches and schools, provides an opportunity share information and solicit feedback on rate/fee options and GSP elements.

Public Meetings/Hearing Public meetings or hearings are formal opportunities for people to provide official comments on programs, plans and proposals. SGMA requires that a public meeting be held prior to the adoption of a fee and public hearings for the adoptions of GSP elements and the final plan. There are also constitutional requirements for public hearings for some fee/rate options. Public meetings and hearings are an important forum for people to share viewpoints and concerns, but often occur at the end of a process, when only one option is under consideration. The GSA will 5 hold required public meetings and hearings but will also use less formal public workshops (described below) to solicit feedback and information early in the process. Public Workshops Public educational workshops provide less formal, opportunities for people to learn about groundwater, SGMA, financing options, and GSP elements. Workshops can be organized in a variety of ways, including open houses, world cafes and traditional presentations with facilitated question and answer sessions. In order to solicit feedback from people who may not be comfortable speaking in public, workshops can include small group breakout discussions, “dot” voting, comment cards and other techniques. Whatever format of workshop is used, it will be designed to maximize opportunities for public input. A workshop will be held in the spring of Year One (2018) to describe and solicit feedback on fee/rate options. Workshops will also be held as GSP elements are being developed. Public Notices In addition to the public notice required for fee adoption, SGMA requires that prior to initiating the development of a GSP, the GSA must provide a written statement describing the manner in which interested parties may participate in the development and implementation of the GSP. The statement must be provided to all the cities within the basin and to the County of Sonoma. As outlined in this Community Engagement Plan, there will be a variety of opportunities for people to participate in the development and implementation of the GSP, including workshops, public hearings, providing comments at Board and Advisory Committee meetings and through written comments. In early 2018, staff and legal counsel will develop a written statement for public participation.

Interest-Based Seats Interested individuals from the community or local organizations may apply to the SVGSA Board, designating in the application the seat that the applicant would intend to fill. The SVGSA Board encourages interest groups to work together to recommend a single candidate to fill that interest’s seat. The Board will give strong consideration to appointing candidates that have the backing of multiple organizations or individuals within that interest group and familiarity with groundwater and its management. The Board will also give strong preference to a representative who lives or works within a Sonoma Valley Disadvantaged Community (as defined in SGMA), and will in any case give preference to appointees that can represent the interests of disadvantaged populations or interests that are otherwise under represented on the Advisory Committee. Additionally, the Board will give preference to applicants with experience working with diverse community-based groups.","1-16

Advisory Committee members also report to, and seek input, from their larger constituency groups on key components and proposals related to GSP development. The Advisory Committee meets between 8 and 12 times annually, and the meetings are open to the public in compliance with California’s Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code Section 54950). The Advisory Committee makes written recommendations to the GSA Board that reflect the outcome of Advisory Committee discussions. To ensure that all viewpoints are heard and considered by the GSA Board, the Advisory Committee reports to the GSA Board identifying areas of agreement and disagreement among the Advisory Committee members. The names of GSA Board and Advisory Committee members can be found in Appendix 1-B, and the Advisory Committee Charter is provided in Appendix 1-C.

These groundwater resources are relied upon to varying degrees by rural and urban residents, vineyards and wineries, dairies, and other businesses, and also support streamflows and ecosystems present in Sonoma Valley. Groundwater represents the primary, or in some cases only, source of supply for agriculture, rural residents, mutual water companies, irrigated park lands, golf courses, and other commercial businesses located outside of the City of Sonoma and VOMWD service areas. Local groundwater represents an important supplemental source of supply for both the City of Sonoma and VOMWD, which operate municipal wellfields within the basin and watershed.",Figure 2-6,"1.

Arsenic, boron, TDS, and chloride have been identified as naturally occurring constituents of interest through previous studies within the Subbasin (for example, Farrar et al. 2006).
Arsenic
Water-sample analyses for arsenic were available from 112 wells within the Subbasin and contributing watershed between 2010 and 2019. The occurrence and distribution of arsenic in groundwater samples is displayed on Figure 3-16b. Groundwater samples from 19 of the 112 wells (17 percent) exceeded the MCL of 10 μg/L for arsenic. Areas of elevated arsenic concentrations are most notable north of Highway 121 along the 8th Street East corridor and in the vicinity of the Eastside Fault (which likely serves as a source of upwelling thermal water in this area). Other areas of higher arsenic concentrations are also associated with thermal water sources and/or known or inferred faults.&&&
Boron
Water-sample analyses for boron were available from 56 wells within the Subbasin and contributing watershed between 2010 and 2019. The occurrence and distribution of boron in groundwater is displayed on Figure 3-16d. Groundwater samples from 10 of the 56 wells (18 percent) exceeded 1,000 μg/L for boron. Groundwater wells exhibiting elevated boron levels are commonly coincident with wells that exhibit elevated arsenic levels (Forrest et al. 2013), which indicate the distribution and occurrence of boron may be influenced by the presence of thermal water and faults.&&&
Chloride
Water-sample analyses for chlorides were available from 111 wells within the Subbasin and contributing watershed areas between 2010 and 2019. The occurrence and distribution of chlorides in groundwater within the watershed is displayed on Figure 3-16e. No groundwater samples exceeded the secondary MCL of 250 mg/L for chlorides during the 2010 to 2019 timeframe. Concentrations of chlorides in excess of 100 mg/L are limited to the southeastern portions of the Subbasin from wells in the Carneros area and east of the Eastside Fault. These wells are either wholly or primarily completed within the Huichica Formation and the elevated chlorides in these wells that are too low to be indicative of seawater intrusion, are likely associated with deep connate waters associated with ancient seawater entrapped during deposition of the Tertiary Era Huichica Formation, which is consistent with the findings from the age-dating and trace-element data described above.&&&
Total Dissolved Solids
Water-sample analyses for TDS (and SC as a surrogate for TDS) were available from 139 wells within the Subbasin and contributing watershed between 2010 and 2019 (18 within the shallow aquifer system and 121 within the deep aquifer system). The occurrence and distribution of TDS in groundwater is displayed on Figures 3-16g and 3-16h for the shallow- and deep aquifer systems, respectively. Groundwater samples from 3 of the 17 shallow aquifer system wells and groundwater samples from 19 of the 121 deep aquifer system wells exceeded the secondary MCL for TDS.
For the shallow aquifer system wells, the highest concentrations of TDS (greater than 1,000 mg/L) are from shallow wells completed within Quaternary Bay Muds in the tidal marshlands near San Pablo Bay, which is consistent with the brackish water present within the tidal marshlands. The only other sample within the shallow aquifer system which exceeds 500 mg/L for TDS occurs just south of Highway 121 in the vicinity of Hyde/Burndale roads. The distribution of TDS within the shallow aquifer system is not well constrained due to the relatively sparse amount of available data.&&&
3.2.6.3 Anthropogenic Constituents of Interest
Nitrate 
Water-sample analyses for nitrate were available from 133 wells within the Subbasin and contributing watershed between 2010 and 2019. The occurrence and distribution of nitrate in groundwater is displayed on Figure 3-16j. Concentrations of nitrate in excess of 10 mg/L occur sporadically in limited areas of the Subbasin, with the majority of these occurring within the shallow aquifer system. The majority of wells (approximately 88 percent) sampled for nitrate within the watershed exhibit very low (<2 mg/L) to non-detectable concentrations of nitrate.&&&
Regulated Contaminant Release Sites
There are numerous currently regulated contaminant release sites located in the Subbasin. Many of the sites are under active cleanup order by the Regional Water Quality Control Boards or County of Sonoma Department of Health Services, Environmental Health and Safety. These sites include leaking underground tanks from gasoline and solvent storage. The SWRCB’s GeoTracker website identifies eight open site cases within the watershed (SWRCB 2021). These releases, which include petroleum and chlorinated solvent contaminants and metals, are generally of limited areal extent, although impacts on private water-supply wells have occurred. No known impacts on public water-supply wells have occurred related to these release sites.
The SWRCB GAMA Priority Basin Project study of the North San Francisco Bay Groundwater Basins has included two studies by the USGS, which evaluated inorganic and organic constituents in groundwater, including constituents associated with regulated contaminant release sites (Kulongoski et al. 2010; Bennett and Fram 2014). The first study conducted in 2004 included samples from 18 public water-supply wells in the watershed (Kulongoski et al. 2010). The second study conducted in 2012 included samples from seven private domestic wells in the watershed (Bennett and Fram 2014). These samples were analyzed for up to 270 constituents and water-quality indicators, including volatile organic compounds, pesticides, nutrients, major and minor ions, trace elements, radioactivity, microbial indicators, dissolved noble gases, and naturally occurring isotopes (Kulongoski et al. 2010; Bennett and Fram 2014). Three of the 25 public and private wells sampled as part of the SWRCB GAMA program had very low-level detections of volatile organic compounds and/or pesticides, but all detections were significantly below the contaminant’s respective MCLs (Kulongoski et al. 2010; Bennett and Fram 2014).","Page 3-67 / 3.2.6.2

ISW/GDE,BASIN SETTING,Interconnected Surface Waters (ISW),Environment,1,"Are gaining and losing reaches adequately assessed spatially and temporally (e.g., groundwater levels (from proximate wells to streams and sufficient density of wells along streams) compared with stream elevation; numerical modelling)?

 ISW map and ISWs were delineated using multiple water year types AND description of temporal variability= yes","Interconnected surface water, ISW, gaining, losing",Somewhat,"Reaches of interconnected surface water in the watershed are identified through several different lines of evidence, including (1) results of seepage-run monitoring, (2) frequency of observed or measured streamflow, (3) comparison of interpolated groundwater levels within the shallow aquifer system and streambed elevations, and (4) high-frequency groundwater-level observations from shallow monitoring wells located near streams. The surface waters assessed using these datasets include Sonoma Creek and its primary tributaries within the watershed, which have been monitored through these data-collection efforts. Synoptic streamflow measurements (seepage runs) have been conducted on Sonoma Creek and its tributaries in May 2003 and spring and fall of 2010 by the USGS and routinely since 2014 by the Sonoma Ecology Center, which measures discharge at more than 50 locations semiannually and around 20 locations on a monthly basis. These seepage runs consist of a series of streamflow measurements made at several sites over a short-time period (for example, single day to several days) along Sonoma Creek and its tributaries to quantify streamflow gains and losses for a specific time period. Specifically, the discharge is measured at an upstream and downstream location along a stream reach. A positive change in discharge in the downstream direction indicates gaining conditions whereas a negative change indicates losing conditions. Under gaining conditions, the source of additional streamflow is groundwater inflow. For groundwater inflow to occur, it is a reasonable assumption that groundwater levels adjacent to a stream are higher than the stream stage. Under losing conditions, the loss of streamflow is from water percolating through the streambed to the underlying aquifer. For water to leave the stream, groundwater levels must be lower than the stream stage. Under conditions where the groundwater level is below the stream stage, interconnected surface water conditions can still occur if groundwater levels are at or above the streambed.

&& The bullets below provide a brief explanation to help understand the seepage measurements displayed on Figures 3-19 through 3-23, and the narrative text that follows the bullets provides interpretation of the seepage measurement datasets.

&& Figure 3-20 provides a comparison of streambed elevations with interpolated spring 2015 groundwater levels within the shallow aquifer system. Areas of interconnected surface water occur where unconfined groundwater levels equal or exceed streambed or ground surface elevations (non-negative depths on Figure 3-20). Such areas are mapped in Sonoma Valley Subbasin by subtracting spring 2015 groundwater elevations from the streambed elevations. The streambed elevations were extracted from the Sonoma County Vegmap 2013 LiDAR (Watershed Sciences, Inc. 2016).

&& • Figure 3-21 shows the percentage of measurements with measurable and zero discharge from the stream seepage runs. Stream reaches with zero discharge are indicative of the absence of interconnected surface waters. • Figures 3-22a through Figure 3-22f show the semiannual seepage-run results in terms of rate of seepage for 2016 through 2018. Negative values/cooler colors indicate losing reaches and positive values/warmer colors indicate gaining reaches. Results from the semiannual seepage measurements were used to assess reaches likely to be interconnected based on occurrences of gaining stream conditions. • Figure 3-23 shows the likely areas of interconnected surface water within the watershed based on evaluation of the above seepage measurement datasets on Figures 3-19a through 3-22f.

&& Groundwater elevations from 17 shallow monitoring wells at 13 locations near streams in Sonoma Valley, equipped with high-frequency monitoring provided by dedicated pressure transducers, were used to further assess and corroborate the mapping of interconnected surface water in the Subbasin.1 Streambed elevations near each monitoring well were obtained from LiDAR datasets to compare with groundwater elevations and assess interconnectedness, as only a few shallow wells have stream-surface water measurements near enough to assess the presence of gaining or losing conditions. A detailed description of the analysis is provided in Appendix 3-D. Summary results of a review of these hydrographs at the 13 locations indicate the following:","Page 3-86-87 / 3.2.7.1

2. Update model inputs for:
a. Precipitation

3. Use climate data in model to:

c. Evaluate effects of projected sea-level rise on groundwater levels
Projections of future climate conditions are generally performed through GCMs forced with specific global greenhouse gas emission scenarios (IPCC 2013). Sea-level rise assumptions were developed and applied separately.
GCM Projection – The projections reviewed for purposes of developing this GSP relied upon available climate projections using the models and emissions scenarios included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). Twenty individual downscaled GCM projections were reviewed using ten different GCMs and two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The 10 GCMs were chosen by DWR CCTAG based on a regional evaluation of climate model ability to reproduce a range of historical climate conditions (DWR CCTAG 2015). For GSP planning purposes, it is desirable to identify projected climate scenarios that more specifically represent the climate and hydrologic conditions within the Russian River watershed and Sonoma County. The evaluation identified the HadGEM2-ES GCM as best representing the middle of the ensemble for mean climate and hydrologic metrics for the Russian River watershed, as it did not stray to any of the extremes for other metric rankings.

The major urban water suppliers in the Subbasin are the City of Sonoma and Valley of the Moon Water District, which rely primarily on imported Russian River water supplied by Sonoma Water, but which also pump groundwater for supplemental supply, and during droughts and in emergencies. These water suppliers serve most of the urban communities, which account for about 13 percent of land use. Agriculture—primarily wine grapes—which relies on groundwater, local surface water, and recycled water, accounts for 44 percent of land use. Native vegetation or water bodies make up 43 percent of land use (Figure ES-3).

The choice of the 1-in-200 change scenario is consistent with: (1) the choice of emissions scenario considered for future climate to be simulated by the model and (2) sea-level rise assumptions used for the Sonoma Creek Baylands Strategy (Sonoma Land Trust and San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority 2020). Exchange between the aquifer and San Pablo Bay is simulated in both the historical and future period as a head-dependent flow using the General Head Boundary package.

Locally defined significant and unreasonable conditions were determined based on public meetings, and discussions with GSA staff, Advisory Committee members, and the GSA Board. Significant and unreasonable chronic lowering of groundwater levels in the Subbasin are defined as: Chronic lowering of groundwater-levels that significantly exceed historical levels or cause significant and unreasonable impacts on beneficial users, such as the following: • Declining groundwater levels that limit the ability of domestic, municipal, or agricultural well owners to access groundwater for beneficial uses (for example, falling groundwater levels below pumping depths of water supply wells), causing significant and unreasonable economic burden on those who rely on basin groundwater &&& 
.4.5.4.2 Potential Causes of Undesirable Results
The potential causes of undesirable results for chronic lowering of groundwater levels include: • Continuation of chronic groundwater-level declines within the deep aquifer system in the southern portions of the Subbasin • Increased groundwater pumping in other areas of the Subbasin leading to chronic groundwater-level declines • A significant reduction in natural recharge as a result of climate change, reduced groundwater and surface water interaction, or other land surface processes If the location and volumes of groundwater pumping change as a result of unforeseen rural residential, agricultural, and urban growth that depend on groundwater as a water supply without supplemental supplies, these increased demands might lower groundwater to undesirable levels. Reduction in recharge or changes in rainfall patterns could also lead to more prolonged periods of lowered groundwater levels than have occurred historically.&&&

Significant and unreasonable chronic lowering of groundwater levels in the Subbasin are defined as: Chronic lowering of groundwater-levels that significantly exceed historical levels or cause significant and unreasonable impacts on beneficial users, such as the following: • Declining groundwater levels that limit the ability of domestic, municipal, or agricultural well owners to access groundwater for beneficial uses (for example, falling groundwater levels below pumping depths of water supply wells), causing significant and unreasonable economic burden on those who rely on basin groundwater • Groundwater levels falling near basin boundaries that indicate impacts on or from neighboring basins • Falling groundwater levels that cause impacts on groundwater-dependent vegetation (shallow aquifer only)&&&
To develop these SMC, staff convened two practitioner work groups to provide expert input on: (1) mapping of GDEs and (2) development of the SMC for depletion of interconnected surface water. Collectively, these work groups met seven times between July 2020 and March 2021.&&&
4.10.4.1 Criteria for Defining Undesirable Results
The depletion of interconnected surface water undesirable result is defined using groundwater levels as a proxy. Per the GSP Regulations, the description of undesirable results is based on a quantitative description of the combination of MT exceedances that cause significant and unreasonable effects in the Subbasin. For the Subbasin, the specific groundwater conditions that constitute an undesirable result is: Undesirable result occurs if MTs are exceeded at 40 percent of RMP wells during drought years and 10 percent of RMP wells during non-drought years.
The different percentages associated with drought years versus non-drought years were selected to help address the concerns expressed by some work group and Advisory Committee members that setting MTs at levels experienced during significant droughts could be detrimental to aquatic species and associated habitat if allowed during future normal and wet years. Placing the different weights on drought and non-drought years helps address the expressed concern by ensuring that during normal/wet years the higher levels of estimated streamflow depletion from 2014–2016 are avoided.
Exceedances of MTs at a single RMP will require investigation to determine if any actions should be considered to avoid potential future onset of undesirable results, as described in Section 4.10.4.2.
4.10.4.2 Potential Causes of Undesirable Results
Many factors influence surface water flows and interconnected surface water depletion, which are outside the control of the GSA. For undesirable results to occur, the cause of surface water depletion must be related to the extraction of groundwater or other project and management actions implemented for groundwater sustainability, and not due to lack of precipitation during periods of prolonged drought or surface water diversions under the jurisdiction of the SWRCB. Undesirable results may occur in the future to GDEs if groundwater-level declines near creeks are caused by groundwater pumping or if there is reduced recharge in the shallow aquifer system.","Page 4-11 / 4.5.1

Please identify which constituents have Minimum Thresholds and Measurable Objectives in the Notes.,No - none Somewhat - only some COCs Yes - both,"minimum threshold, water quality, groundwater quality, contaminent, constituent of concern, COC",Somewhat,"4.8.2.2 Level of Concern for each Constituent of Concern
Each COC has an associated level of concern for each category of beneficial user. For the drinking water supply well category, the level of concern is represented by the MCL or SMCL, as applicable.
The SFBRWQCB Basin Plan designates municipal and agricultural water quality management objectives for the Sonoma Valley. The municipal designation aims to maintain water quality for public supplies below the California MCL and SMCL drinking water standards (SFBRWQRCB 2019). The agricultural designation aims to maintain water quality for irrigation below specific thresholds that may be harmful to certain crops (SFBRWQCB 2019). The basis for establishing MTs for each COC in the Subbasin are summarized in Table 4-6. This table does not identify the total number of supply wells that may exceed the level of concern, but rather identifies how many additional wells will be allowed to exceed the level of concern. Wells that already exceed this level are not counted against the MTs.
Minimum Threshold Based on Number of Wells
Arsenic One additional supply well exceeds the arsenic MCL of 0.010 mg/L. Nitrate One additional supply well exceeds the nitrate measured as nitrogen MCL of 10 mg/L. TDS One additional supply well exceeds the TDS recommended SMCL of 500 mg/L. &&&
4.8.2.3 Development of Minimum Thresholds at Supply Wells
The MTs for degraded water quality for the supply wells are based on the number of additional exceedances of any MCL or SMCL in existing supply wells shown in Table 4-6. Establishing the MT as the number of additional exceedances accounts for supply wells with previous exceedances, assuming these exceedances will likely continue into the future. The GSA Board selected one as the number of additional supply wells with exceedances to represent the MT. The MT for the number of allowed exceedances is therefore equal to the baseline number of exceedances (calculated as the number of supply wells with any MCL or SMCL exceedance between 2015 and 2020) plus one additional supply well with an exceedance. Based on the number of supply wells in the existing water quality monitoring network, the number of existing exceedances since 2015 for each constituent is tabulated in Table 4-7 and the distribution of exceedances are shown on Figures 4-4 through 4-6, along with all of the other supply wells included in the initial RMP network. MT exceedances are based on existing supply wells only. According to the GSP Regulations, the MTs are based on the same number of supply wells to have exceedances, not necessarily the same wells. The well networks will be re-assessed every 5 years to identify any new supply wells that could be added to the monitoring networks. The MT will be increased by one for each new supply well added to the monitoring network with an initial measured concentration exceeding the MCL or SMCL. Additionally, if the MCL or SMCL changes for a GSP-identified COC, the specific MT should be examined and updated as appropriate.&&&

",NO: no mention Somewhat: mention vaguely &/ only for one MT section YES: mention in both MT sections and use quantitative data to justify/describe,"minimum threshold, disadvantaged communit*, drinking water users, domestic, domestic wells, groundwater levels, water quality, groundwater quality",Somewhat,"The MTs were set at each RMP based on three primary factors: 1. Review of groundwater-level data and hydrographs to identify the lowest historical groundwater elevation at each RMP after removing any measurements flagged as “questionable measurements” or otherwise anomalous measurements from the datasets. 2. Calculation of “well impact depths” in the vicinity of each RMP to identify depths at which lowering of groundwater levels may impact well users, including domestic, agricultural, public supply, and industrial wells. 3. Calculation of a “drought factor or buffer” to account for reasonably foreseeable future droughts at each RMP with recent groundwater levels that are not below or approaching the above calculated well impact depth.
Calculation of Well Impact Depths
The methodology for incorporating the potential impact on existing well users involved the statistical evaluation of known completion information for water supply wells located within the vicinity of each potential RMP. These statistics were calculated by drawing polygons for each potential RMP area and querying Sonoma Water’s Water Well Database (sourced from DWR’s Online System for Well Completion Reports, Permit Sonoma, and the USGS). Generally, the Subbasin boundary and midpoints between potential RMPs were used to draw the vicinity areas. In some cases, physical features that appear to have a direct influence on groundwater movement were used as boundaries to the vicinity areas, such as the Eastside Fault or Sonoma Creek. The total number of supply wells, shallowest supply well total depth, 98th percentile shallowest supply well total depth, and the average supply well depth were calculated for each vicinity area polygon. For each RMP, the analysis included all types of supply wells contained within the datasets (domestic wells, irrigation wells, public supply wells, and industrial wells) with the listed total depth occurring in the same aquifer system as the RMP&&&
Urban land uses and users. The chronic lowering of groundwater-level MTs protect existing municipal groundwater users’ ability to meet typical demands by maintaining groundwater levels near current conditions. However, the chronic lowering of groundwater-level MTs do place a practical limit on the acceptable lowering of groundwater levels in the Subbasin, thus conceptually restricting the current level of municipal and industrial pumping in some areas of the Subbasin. These restrictions could reduce the amount of agricultural pumping; however, projects and management actions detailed in Section 6 will be pursued to allow for alternatives to reductions in municipal pumping.
Domestic land uses and users. The chronic lowering of groundwater levels MTs are established to protect as many rural residential domestic wells as possible. Therefore, the MTs will likely have an overall beneficial effect on existing domestic land uses by protecting the ability to pump from domestic wells within the Subbasin.&&&
The currently available supply wells for monitoring COCs that have an MCL or SMCL are public supply wells. Should domestic wells or agricultural irrigation wells be incorporated into future monitoring programs established by the GSA or other entities, they could also be included in monitoring COCs during future GSP updates.&&&
Urban land uses and users. The degradation of groundwater quality MTs is designed to avoid negative effects to groundwater quality associated with implementation of the GSP.

CCR Title 23 Section 354.28(c)(6) of the GSP Regulations states that “The minimum threshold for depletions of interconnected surface water shall be the rate or volume of surface water depletions caused by groundwater use that has adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the surface water and may lead to undesirable results.”
Available data are currently insufficient to directly calculate the rate or volume of surface water depletions from streamflow measurements or reliably estimate depletions from a surface water budget. Quantifying surface water depletion due to pumping is a challenge because: (1) it cannot be measured directly and (2) the influence of surface water depletion by pumping is often obscured by other factors, such as precipitation and runoff, surface water diversions, ET, and natural groundwater/surface water interactions. Therefore, groundwater levels are used as a proxy for the rate or volume of surface water depletion for these initial SMC. Groundwater levels as a proxy metric for the depletion of interconnected surface water sustainability indicator are considered the best option because: The depletion of interconnected surface water is driven by the gradient between water surface elevation in the surface water body and groundwater elevations in the connected, shallow aquifer system. • Groundwater levels are one of the controlling factors in supporting rooting depths for vegetation-based GDEs. • Groundwater levels represent criteria that the GSA has direct authority to manage within the Subbasin (for example, compared with streamflows that can be strongly influenced by the factors described above, as well as inflows from upland areas outside of the Subbasin).
4.10.2.1 Information and Methodology Used to Establish Surface Water Depletion Minimum Thresholds
The information used for establishing the MTs and MOs for the depletion of interconnected surface water sustainability indicator included: • Results of seepage run monitoring (described in Section 3.2.7.1) • Frequency of observed or measured streamflow • Comparison of interpolated groundwater levels within the shallow aquifer system and streambed elevations • High-frequency groundwater-level observations from shallow monitoring wells located near streams • Map of interconnected surface water reaches within the Subbasin • Map of the distribution of GDEs within the Subbasin • Input from the practitioner work group for interconnected surface water &&&
The general procedure for developing the initial SMC involves the following:
1. Use groundwater levels measured at shallow monitoring wells near streams (RMPs) as a proxy for surface water depletion. 2. Use this model to estimate the 3 years with highest levels of simulated streamflow depletion between 2004 and 2018. 3. Calculate the percentile ranking of simulated dry-season groundwater levels associated with these years. 4. Set initial MTs at this percentile ranking using available datasets for wells measured near RMPs. As further detailed in Appendix 4-C, for RMP locations with insufficient groundwater-level period of record, the initial MTs are set based on either: (1) match points from nearby wells with a sufficient period of record or (2) the adjacent streambed elevation. 5. Set initial MO as mean of dry-season measured groundwater levels from historical record.&&&
4.10.2.4 Effect on Beneficial Uses and Users
Ecological land uses and users. The main benefit of the surface water depletion MTs is to GDEs (primarily aquatic species and riparian vegetation). Maintaining shallow groundwater levels near streams at or above historical low levels helps maintain interconnected conditions and historical levels of baseflow. Better understanding the causal effects of interconnected surface water depletion due to groundwater pumping on GDEs and habitat is a primary focus of the early stages of GSP implementation and will be used to refine the MTs in future GSP updates, as appropriate.","Page 4-21 / 4.5.2.4

Recycled water can be used in applications where potable water is often used, such as the irrigation of public parks and golf courses, and for agriculture. In addition to allowing for potable water offsets, recycled water use can facilitate in lieu groundwater recharge. For example, if a farm that has historically used well water for crop irrigation begins using recycled water instead, the groundwater aquifer beneath will recover through reduced pumping and natural recharge. Additionally, using recycled water for irrigation also means a decrease in discharge of treated wastewater to local water bodies such as the San Pablo Bay.",Page 6-5 / 6.2.2,Planned project to augment supply with the use of recycled water in place of potable water (2 proposed supply augmentation projects also included)

Expected benefits from implementation of water use efficiency and alternate water source projects are described in detail in Appendix 6-A. For the purpose of estimating the potential benefits of these projects, it was assumed that the Group 1 scenario simulates the impacts of a 20 percent reduction in all rural domestic use and a 10 percent reduction in consumptive use for all vineyards, beginning in 2025. This assumption was considered to represent a reasonable level of groundwater use reduction based on the outcomes from existing BMPs and other water-use efficiency programs. Other groundwater-use sectors would be included in the project, including commercial, industrial, and agricultural crops. However, for the purpose of conducting the scenario modeling, only reductions in rural domestic and vineyard groundwater use were applied, as these components were most readily able to be incorporated in the model.
Based on these assumptions and as described in Appendix 6-A, expected benefits include reduction in the number of potential future MT exceedances for the chronic lowering of groundwater levels sustainability indicator, as well as decreasing the decline in groundwater storage, reducing inflows from the Baylands area, and improving net surface water and groundwater exchange. Benefits simulated by the model relative to the baseline scenario for the Group 1 scenario, which primarily includes the water-use efficiency projects but also includes the addition of existing recycled water contracts, are summarized as follows:
• Simulated project yields: total of 651 AFY (377 AFY from reduction in vineyard consumptive use, 223 AFY reduction in rural domestic groundwater use, and 51 AFY of recycled water delivery offsets)
• Simulated increase in groundwater levels: 5- to 30-foot increase, with largest increases east of the Eastside Fault
• Simulated increase in groundwater storage: 110 AFY
• Simulated net reduction in surface water depletion: 140 AFY
• Simulated reduction to inflows from the Baylands area: 120 AFY

Potential benefits from implementation of recycled water projects are described in Appendix 6-A. Using the assumptions described in Appendix 6-A, potential benefits include reduction in the number of potential future MT exceedances for the chronic lowering of groundwater levels, as well as decreasing the projected decline in groundwater storage. Benefits from recycled water projects would primarily be evaluated using changes in measured groundwater levels and improvements to groundwater storage changes. Benefits are simulated by the model for the Group 2A scenario (relative to the Group 1 scenario). Group 2A primarily includes the recycled water system expansion, but also includes the addition of ASR at two locations, with benefits summarized as follows:
• Simulated project yields: total of 342 for expanded recycled water deliveries (Group 2A also includes 140 AFY for ASR at City of Sonoma and VOMWD existing well sites)
• Simulated increase in groundwater levels: 15- to 20-foot increase, with largest increases east of the Eastside Fault
• Simulated increase in groundwater storage: 60 AFY
• Simulated net reduction in surface water depletion: 80 AFY
• Simulated reduction to inflows from the Baylands area: 80 AFY","Page ES-13 / ES.3.6

This study will prepare a prioritized list of potential policy options, including stronger demand management actions that may need to be adopted should the projects described above not be implementable or successful.

Yes: Explicitly identifies climate change as a reason for obtaining/crossing thresholds for SMC",climate change,Yes,"The potential causes of undesirable results for chronic lowering of groundwater levels include:
• Continuation of chronic groundwater-level declines within the deep aquifer system in the southern portions of the Subbasin
• Increased groundwater pumping in other areas of the Subbasin leading to chronic groundwater-level declines
• A significant reduction in natural recharge as a result of climate change, reduced groundwater and surface water interaction, or other land surface processes

The potential causes of undesirable results for reduction of groundwater storage are the same as those identified for chronic lowering of groundwater levels in Section 4.5.4.2:
• Continuation of chronic groundwater-level declines within the deep aquifer system in the southern portions of the Subbasin, as described in Section 3.2.4
• Increased groundwater pumping in other areas of the Subbasin leading to chronic groundwater-level declines
• A significant reduction in natural recharge as a result of climate change or other processes

Because of the significant data gaps, an adaptive approach for refining the initial SMC for seawater intrusion will be completed during GSP implementation. Additional characterization described in Section 7 will provide a more robust understanding of not only current conditions, but also potential future impacts from climate change (such as sea level rise) and land use practices in the Baylands area of the Subbasin.","Page 4-24 / 4.5.4.2
