,GENERAL,,General Notes ,,,,GSP Information,Answer,,,
,,,"SH: GSP identified most of the basin as DACs, Lookout Rancheria (associated with Pit River Tribe) was identified as a tribal stakeholder within the basin. The GSP does mention limitations to GSP engagement with stakeholders. 
ISW: map of ISWs included; groundwater data from only 2015 used and a criteria of 15 feet of shallower; very few ISWs mapped, and then the SMC and montiroing network sections do not even address ISWs based on the flawed logic that there is not enough evidence; data gaps identified in section 7.3.6
GDE: flora is described but fauna and critical/endangered/threatened species were not; clear description of methods; again, only 2015 groundwater data used and a criteria of 15 feet or shallower; unsure if the groundwater monitoring wells presented in section 5-1 are adaquete to identify groundwater conditions around GDEs
CC: GSP used DWR change factors (unspecified) to account for precip, ET (native not separated), and surface flow (no imports in basin). Projected SY is based on historic pumping. Overall one of the most vague water budget sections for a GSP thus far.
SMC: No MT or MO section, very vague on UR
PMA: They haven't clearly detailed the benefits, better evaluation is needed, specifically to GDE, DAC and tribes
Other: No mention of OpenET, voluntary metering programing ongoing/continuing, no reference to water markets. PMA section was not very thorough, but ongoing PMAs address demand reduction and proposed PMAs address supply augmentation. Coordination w/ RWQCB briefly mentioned but not discussed.",,,,GSP ID,1,,,

Both counties are disadvantaged, have declining populations, and have no ability to cover the costs of GSP development and implementation.

&&

These disadvantaged communities are on the losing end of the digital divide.While the GSAs made every attempt to conduct BVAC meetings with the ability for remote public participation, there were still major logistical and technical challenges both with conducting such meetings and members of the public participating. Those participants that had internet connectivity frequently could not hear or understand the dialogue in the Big Valley community venues and could not interact in the most effective way. However, the GSAs made the best of the circumstances and addressed all comments provided through the various means. The GSAs recognized the obstacles presented by the COVID pandemic early in the efforts to develop a GSP and were proactive in reaching out to both the Governor and Legislature to identify potential solutions. The Governor severely restricted public meetings (and initially did not allow public meetings at all) because of the pandemic. Obviously, this made the GSAs’ efforts to develop a GSP with constructive input from the public extremely difficult since, as outlined above, there is limited internet connectivity to conduct meetings remotely. Further, the limited GSA staff and technology was challenged to offer meetings remotely.

11.5.2 Website and Communication Portal
A website was deployed for GSP development to facilitate communication and track the communication in a database. The website is meant to enhance, not replace outreach efforts. Tools of the website allowed the GSAs to communicate with interested parties. These tools include the following:
 Calendar. The website includes a calendar with meeting dates, locations, times and documents such as meeting agendas, meeting minutes, presentations and BVAC packets.
 Interested Parties List. The website allows users to add themselves to the interested parties list and to select whether they wish to receive communication through email or physical mail.
 Documents. In addition to the meeting documents mentioned above, the website has a general documents page where the GSAs posted GSP chapters, scientific references and other supported documents related to GSP development.
 E-Blast. E-mails are sent to interested parties using the e-blast tool. E-blasts help to notify interested parties with email addresses to receive information about GSP development progress, upcoming meetings and new information or documents available.
 Public Comment. GSP chapters posted on the website are available for public comment during comment periods throughout GSP development. A web form is available for anyone to submit comments on documents open for comment. The form allows the user to comment by page and line number for GSA review and response. The website address is included on printed materials and announced at public meetings.
11.5.3 Community Flyers Physical copies of flyers announcing upcoming public meetings are posted in high-traffic locations such as community centers, public buildings, local markets and post offices.
11.5.4 Newspaper  All public meetings, including BVAC meetings, are announced in the Lassen County Times, the Modoc Record, The Intermountain News and the Mountain Echo.
11.5.5 Social Media Information about GSP development and meeting announcements have been, and will continue to be, made available through social media. UC Cooperative Extension in Modoc County hosts the Devil’s Garden Research and Education Facebook page, as well as a website with the same name. Through their Facebook page,79 events are publicized and shared with other connected pages in the area to reach a wider stakeholder base. This platform also enables workshops and other events to be shared through live video and recordings. Recently, a blog detailing stakeholder engagement in Big Valley was published to the website.
11.5.6 Brochure In 2021, the GSAs transitioned from the background and scientific portions of the GSP (Chapters 1-6, including Basin Setting and Water Budget) to the policy and decision-making portions of the GSP (Chapters 7-9, Sustainable Management Criteria, Monitoring Networks and Projects and Management Actions). To facilitate engagement of people who may have been coming into the process at that time, a four-page informational brochure was developed, summarizing Chapters 1 through 6. This brochure was distributed on the website, through email and at public meetings. The brochure is included as Appendix 11D.
3115.7 Big Valley Advisory Committee The GSAs established the BVAC through an MOU to advise both Lassen and Modoc counties on GSP
preparation. The goals of the BVAC, as stated in the MOU (Appendix 1C), include the following:
 Advise the two GSAs on the preparation of a GSP
 Provide a forum for the public to comment during the preparation of the GSP
 provide recommendations to the two GSAs that would result in actions which have as minimal impact as
possible on the residents of Big Valley
 Advise the two GSAs on the preparation of a GSP to produce the lowest possible future costs to the
residents of Big Valley
 Ensure local control of the BVGB be maintained by the two GSAs
Prepare a product that is acceptable to the GSA Boards for approval. Membership of the BVAC is composed of:
 one member of the Lassen County Board of Supervisors selected by said Board.
one alternate member of the Lassen County Board of Supervisors selected by said Board.
 one member of the Modoc County Board of Supervisors selected by said Board.
 one alternate member of the Modoc County Board of Supervisors selected by said Board.

 two public members selected by the Modoc County Board of Supervisors. Said members must either
reside or own property within the Modoc County portion of the BVGB.The BVAC operates in compliance with the Ralph M. Brown Act (Brown Act). BVAC meetings are noticed and
agendas posted according to the Brown Act. BVAC meetings are open to the public and public comment is
allowed as much as possible given COVID pandemic restrictions.","ES-1

Lassen and Modoc counties have ben identified as DACs. The GSA makes it clear that lack of funding within the basin has been a challenge to developing the GSP and ensuring stakeholder engagement during COVID-19. With most of the basin being identified as DACs, the GSP ackowledges the challenges of conducting meetings during a pandemic and one of those challenges was virtual meetings with little to no access to stable internet connections and computer devices.

Therefore, tribal contacts have received all notifications of GSP development activity. Applications to become members of the BVAC were sent to the tribes. In addition, the Modoc County Groundwater Resources Advisory Committee, a committee of the Modoc County Board and a forum for obtaining updates about GSP development, has a tribal position. Numerous contacts between Modoc County staff and tribal contacts have occurred during GSP development. A list of outreach activities with tribal contacts is included in Appendix 11C.

Table 5-3 shows that most constituents have not had concentrations measured above their corresponding threshold since 1983 and were not investigated further. Sulfate, aluminum, and antimony only had one or two detections above their threshold, and none of these values were recent so these constituents were not investigated further. Arsenic (As), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), specific conductance (SC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were investigated further. All these constituents are naturally occurring.
Arsenic, Iron and Manganese
As, Fe, and Mn show elevated concentrations in over 10 percent of the wells. Although iron and manganese are regulated under secondary drinking water standards (for aesthetics such as color, taste, and odor) but are not of concern for human health as drinking water, these constituents were still chosen for further investigation because they also have multiple detections above the agricultural suitability threshold (Ayers and Westcot 1985). Figure 5-8 through Figure 5-10 show the trends over time. Wells with single measurements are shown as dots, where wells that had multiple measurements are shown as lines. These figures indicate that the number of wells with highly elevated concentrations of arsenic and manganese concentrations may have decreased over the last 40 years of groundwater use. Iron concentrations are generally below the agricultural suitability threshold (Ayers and Westcot, 1985), with two recent elevated measurements from the monitoring wells constructed in support of the GSP.
Specific Conductance and Total Dissolved Solids
SC is a measure of the water’s ability to conduct electricity. TDS is a measure of the total amount of dissolved materials (e.g., salts) in water. SC and TDS are related to one another (higher TDS results in higher SC) and SC is often used as a proxy for TDS. Although there was only one recent measurement over the MCL for SC, both SC and TDS were investigated further because they are important indicators of general water quality conditions. Figure 5-11 and Figure 5-12 show the trends over time. Wells with single measurements are shown as dots, where wells that had multiple measurements are shown as lines. These figures indicate that the number of wells with highly elevated concentrations of SC and TDS may have decreased over the last 40 years. Figure 5-13 and Figure 5-14 show the distribution of elevated levels of SC and TDS around the Basin.

5.4.2 Groundwater Contamination Sites and Plumes
To determine the location of potential groundwater contamination sites and plumes, the State Water Board’s GeoTracker website was consulted. GeoTracker catalogs known groundwater contamination sites and waste disposal sites (State Water Board 2020b). A search of GeoTracker identified ten sites where groundwater could potentially be contaminated. These sites are in the vicinity of Bieber and Nubieber as listed in Table 5-4 and shown on Figure 5-15. The sites include leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs), cleanup program sites, and a land disposal site. Half of the sites are open and subject to ongoing regulatory requirements. The contaminants are listed in Table 5-4, which also gives a summary of the case history. Most of the contaminants originated at LUST sites are leaking petroleum hydrocarbons, which are light non- aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs). LNAPLs are less dense than water and their solubility is quite low, meaning that if they reach groundwater, they float on top and generally do not migrate into the deeper portions of the aquifer. Moreover, many of the constituents can be degraded by naturally occurring bacteria in soil and groundwater so the hydrocarbons do not migrate far from the LUST sites. However, MTBE,39 TBA,40 and fuel oxygenates are more soluble in water. Two LUST sites and the landfill site are subject to long-term monitoring while a fourth site is ready for case closure. The Bieber Landfill is subject to ongoing semi-annual monitoring of groundwater levels and groundwater quality at four shallow wells. This monitoring is required by the RWQCB (Order No. R5-2007-0175) after the formal closure of the landfill in the early 2000s. Trace concentrations of several organic constituents41 have been detected at MW-1, the closest downgradient well to the site, but rarely at the other three wells. Higher concentrations of inorganic constituents (e.g., TDS, SC, others) are also present at MW-1. During 2019, the landfill was also required to analyze groundwater samples from MW-1, MW-2, and MW-4 for per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are an emerging group of contaminants that are being studied for their effect on human health and may be subject to very low regulatory criteria (parts per trillion). Fifteen of 28 PFASs were detected at MW-1, and nine of 28 PFASs were detected at MW-4 (none at MW-2). The State Water Board/RWQCB evaluation of these data is still pending.

The timing of depletions also cannot be determined with existing data.

&& Section 5.6 presents the available information related to interconnected surface water. It is nearly impossible to quantify surface-water depletion impact based on flow alone, even in an area where there is good data, such as pumping quantity, deep aquifer groundwater elevation, precipitation, and surface flow. Many of these criteria are current data gaps in the Basin, particularly the variation in precipitation and flow across the Basin. Uncertainty in the amount of surface water entering the Basin and the unpredictability of weather patterns has already been established and will continue to be a barrier. Pumping data in the Basin is also a data gap as there is no current monitoring system which annually measures the amount of water pumped. The connection between upland recharge areas and the unique volcanic geologic features surrounding the Basin are mostly unknown and make understanding the connectivity of surface and groundwater very difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, the number of wells located next to streams and the river in the Basin are not quantified. While Chapter 5 – Groundwater Conditions details the streams in Big Valley which may be interconnected by a “...continuous saturated zone to the underlying aquifer and the overlying surface water...” (DWR 2016c), there is currently no evidence to support interconnected surface water. Therefore, there is a lack of evidence for interconnection of streams. Figure 5-18 overlays the general direction(s) of groundwater flow around the Basin inrelation to the major streams. Also shown is the general direction of flow determined from the newly constructed well clusters near Adin and Lookout. The remaining clusters were constructed later and do not yet have a sufficient period of data to determine flow directions with certainty. The newly constructed monitoring wells will continue to gather data on whether there is any evidence of interconnected surface water. Chapter 4 – Hydrogeological Conceptual Model identified data gaps related to the effect of Ash Creek, Pit River, and smaller streams on recharge. These data gaps may partially be filled once adequate data from the five monitoring well clusters are collected. Scientific research related to groundwater and surface water will improve over time. As this science is made available, the GSAs will work to locate funding for improved data depending on available staffing and financial resources.","Page 5-26 / 5.6

Sixteen springs account for a very small area. Most of the springs are in Lassen County (13), although numerous springs are located outside the BVGB boundary. The Vegetation area is subdivided into two primary habitats, based on the plant species. Wet Meadows was the largest primary habitat at 59 percent of the vegetation area, but there was no dominant species. Willow was the second largest habitat at 41 percent of the vegetation area. For the NCCAG areas to be designated as actual GDEs, the groundwater level needs to be close enough to the ground surface that it would support the vegetation. For determining potential GDEs, fall 2015 depth to water is used, because mid-summer months are the critical limiting factor for plant communities. Furthermore, if groundwater moisture isn’t available later in the summer, then the groundwater dependent communities don’t have an advantage over communities that are typically not associated with groundwater, such as sagebrush, juniper, and bunchgrass (Lile 2021). The depth to water that could potentially be accessed by GDEs depends on the rooting depth of the vegetation. An assessment of native plants in the BVGB found that maximum rooting depths of species present is 10 feet as shown in Table 5-5. Access to groundwater by plant roots extends above the water table because the groundwater is drawn upward to fill soil pores, and this zone is known as the capillary fringe. The thickness of the capillary fringe extends upward several feet, depending on the soil type.

&& As a conservative estimate, a capillary fringe of 10 feet is used. In order for plants to access the water and thrive,not just barely touch, there needs to be significant overlap (of, say 5 feet) between the rooting depth and the capillary fringe (Lile 2021). Furthermore, while roots may extend to a deep level, documentation of maximum depth to water for some of the deep-rooting species in Table 5-5 to thrive is on the order of 2-3 meters (6-9 feet) (Pezeshki and Shields 2006, Springer et. al. 1999). Therefore, as a conservative estimate for the purposes of delineating GDEs, only those areas in the NCCAG datasets that are in areas with fall 2015 groundwater less than 15 feet are classified as potential GDEs.

For this section, it is necessary to understand that it is natural (and expected) that groundwater levels will rise and fall during a particular year and over the course of many years. Chapters 4 through 6 describe the nature of groundwater levels throughout the Basin and how levels have changed over time. These chapters conclude that many areas of the Basin have seen no significant change. Other areas saw a lowering of levels in the late 1980s and early 1990s, recovery during the wet period of the late 1990s and lowering water levels since 2000. Groundwater usage has only seen minor increases since 2000, therefore the declines are more related to climatic conditions than to a lack of stewardship of the resource. As illustrated in Figure 5-4, water levels in 12 wells have shown stable (less than one foot of change) or rising water levels. Nine wells have shown declining trends, with only three of those wells declining by more than two feet per year. This context is given both to set the stage for discussion of undesirable results and to illustrate that water levels overall have not declined significantly. This re-emphasizes the point raised in Section 1.3 that the GSAs believe the Basin should be ranked as low priority. As mentioned previously, the GSAs also believe its ranking of medium priority is due in large part to the DWR’s scoring of all basins with water level declines with a fixed number of points rather than considering the severity of declines. Big Valley has seen only minor declines in comparison to the widespread decline of hundreds of feet experienced elsewhere in the state. The Basin has demonstrated that it can recover during wet climatic cycles (e.g., late 1990s) as shown in Figure 5-7. There have not been widespread reports of issues or concerns regarding groundwater levels from the residents of the Basin (whether agricultural producers or domestic users or others). The GSAs contend that Big Valley’s medium priority ranking is based on unscientific concerns raised by DWR based on isolated wells that experienced limited decline during a below- average climatic cycle. Therefore, undesirable results have not occurred in the past and the measurable objective established in this section is set at the fall 2015 groundwater level for each well in the monitoring network (see Chapter 8 – Monitoring Networks). Fall 2015 is the most recent measurement prior to the adoption of this GSP and is generally the lowest groundwater level throughout the period of record. Since these levels are economically feasible for agricultural uses, this level is a reasonable proxy for the desired conditions.
Description
This section describes undesirable results for groundwater levels by defining significant and unreasonable impacts on beneficial uses. As described in Section 1.1 and emphasized in the Sustainability Goal, agricultural production is of paramount importance due to its economic, cultural, and environmental benefits. For agricultural pursuits to be viable, growers need a large margin of operational flexibility (refer to Figure 7-1) so that crops can be irrigated even during dry years. Accordingly, and consistent with the goal, 140 feet below the 2015 groundwater level was established as the minimum threshold. Consistent with the Sustainability Goal, significant and unreasonable lowering of groundwater levels is defined as the level where the energy cost to lift groundwater exceeds the economic value of the water for agriculture. Through discussions in BVAC ad hoc committee meetings among committee members, a local well driller (Conner 2021) and the Lassen County Farm Advisor (Lile 2021), the MT was determined to be the depth at which groundwater pumping becomes economically unfeasible for agricultural use. The increase in horsepower required to pump from a well approaching the MT would result in an increased cost of $15 per acre foot of water using Surprise Valley Electric (SVE) rates and $30 per acre foot using Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) rates (Conner 2021). Calculated on a per-ton basis, the increased cost of water level decline to the MT translates to about $6.50 per ton using SVE power and $13 per ton with PG&E (see Appendix 7A). Total operating costs for a typical grass hay farm in the intermountain area are estimated to be $119 per ton. Total cash costs, not counting land and depreciation are estimated at $138 per ton of hay produced (Orloff et al 2016). Considering hay prices have been in the $200 per ton range (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], Agricultural Marketing Service), the potential increase in required pumping power reduces return over cost by 10 to 20 percent. To produce grain hay, pumping costs are less because less water is required. Because the relative value of grain hay, approximately $120 per ton, is also much less, the overall impact to economic returns is equal if not greater.Thus, the agricultural production economic threshold for well levels is determined to be the MT. Figure 7-2 shows an assessment of the depths of wells throughout the Basin based on DWR well logs.58 While this dataset has inaccuracies, it gives a sense of the impact of lowering water levels on the different well types and indicates that lowering of water levels throughout the Basin to the MT could result in a significant percentage of wells going dry. Many of the shallower wells are likely the oldest wells in the Basin and may be unused or abandoned.
Figure 7-3 shows that domestic well density is not evenly distributed throughout the Basin and that representative wells are located near the areas of highest domestic well density.
&&&
Criteria
The undesirable result criterion for the groundwater level sustainability indicator occurs when the groundwater level in one-third of the representative monitoring wells drop below their minimum threshold for 5 consecutive years. In addition to the above definition of undesirable result, it is recognized that although groundwater levels naturally  fluctuate, some actions may be justified even before levels fall below the minimum threshold at a particular representative well. Thus, the GSAs are defining an “action level” to identify areas within the Basin where management actions and projects are needed (see Chapter 9 – Projects and Management Actions). The definition of the term “Action Level” is also at the discretion of the GSAs. “Action Levels” and the associated protocol are defined as follows: “Action Level”: When monitoring within the established monitoring network identifies the following groundwater level trends, targeted projects or management actions may be considered, at the discretion of the GSAs, when any of the following occur:1/3 of the representative monitoring wells in the Basin decline below the measurable objective (i.e., the fall 2015 baseline levels) for five consecutive years Water levels at a 1/3 of the representative wells decline three times the average historic decline that well experienced between 2000 and 2018 as shown in Appendix 5A Water levels at 1/3 of the representative wells decline more than five feet in one year
Effects
As discussed above, if groundwater levels were to fall below the minimum threshold, pumping costs would render agricultural pursuits in the affected areas unviable. Without agriculture, the unique culture, character of the community, and quality of life for Big Valley residents would be drastically changed. Reductions in agriculture would also affect wildlife who use irrigated lands as habitat, breeding grounds, and feeding grounds. Low water levels could cause wells to go dry, requiring deepening, redrilling, or developing a new water source. However, the long-term costs of agriculture becoming unviable causing reduced property values and tax revenue outweigh the short-term costs of investing in deeper wells or alternative water supplies. The potential effect would be offset by a shallow well mitigation program, which would apply to wells that have gone dry because water levels have fallen below the measurable objective. Substandard (e.g., hand-dug) wells would not qualify for mitigation. Mitigation would rely on a “good neighbor” practice already demonstrated in the Basin and would leverage any state or federal funding that may be secured. For example, the USDA Rural Development has offered low-interest loans to drill new or replace existing wells. Additionally, prior to the first five-year update, a program will be developed (see Chapter 9 – Projects and Management Actions) to cover a portion of the cost if new residential wells must be drilled because groundwater levels drop below the measurable objective. Any such program would apply to legally-established wells and would be dependent on state and federal funding. Criteria will likely include well depth, screen interval, age of the well, and other factors.
&&&
7.3.4 Water Quality
As described in Chapter 5 – Groundwater Conditions, the groundwater quality conditions in the Basin are oveall excellent (DWR 1963, Reclamation 1979). After a review of the best available data on water quality in the Basin, it was concluded that all the constituents which were elevated above suitable thresholds are naturally occurring. There has been no identifiable increase in the level of concentrations over time, and several constituents have indications of improvement in recent decades compared to concentrations in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., Arsenic and Manganese Figures 5-8 and 5-10).
&&&
Domestic water users are also assisting in maintaining good water quality within the Basin through community action. Through the civic process, Big Valley residents were engaged in the development of the Modoc and Lassen County ordinances to deter unlicensed outdoor marijuana growers and the unpermitted use of pesticides and rodenticides which may make their way into the groundwater and surface water. The domestic water users are also actively seeking to assist in code enforcement and reduce the amount of harmful debris within the Big Valley communities that may cause water quality issues. Public outreach through the offices of Public Health, Environmental Health, and the Regional Recycling Group Recycle Used Oil and Filter Campaign will assist in maintaining excellent water quality. These outreach efforts are further discussed in Chapter 9 – Projects and Management Actions. Due to the existence of excellent water quality in the Basin, significant amount of existing water quality monitoring, generally low impact land uses, and a robust effort to conduct conservation efforts by agricultural and domestic users, per §354.26(d), SMCs were not established for water quality because Undesirable Results are not
2306 present and not likely to occur. At the five-year updates of this GSP, data from various existing programs, including the RWQCB sites, public supply wells (regulated by the Division of Drinking Water), and electrical conductivity transducers installed by the GSAs at three wells (BVMW 1-2, 4-1 and 5-1) will be assessed to determine if degradation trends are occurring in the principal aquifer. In addition, water quality impacts resulting from projects and management actions will be evaluated during their planning and implementation. At the five- year update, SMCs will be considered only if the trends indicate that undesirable results are likely to occur in the subsequent 5 years.","Page 7-3 / 7.3.1

One approach to Basin recharge currently being considered is AgMAR, which is the intentional recharge of groundwater aquifers by spreading water over agricultural fields at times when excess surface water (Kocis & Dahlke, 2017, Dahlke et al. 2018). With significant surface-water irrigation and diversions already present in Big Valley, AgMAR is a viable option in the Basin. Much of the current research on AgMAR has been completed on relatively well-drained soils that are not present in Big Valley. Research on Big Valley soils with slow to very- slow infiltration rates appears to be initially promising. While recharge of groundwater may be slower in the Basin it could still be a feasible means for deep water recharge and filling the shallow aquifer and root zone. AgMAR can be utilized for both, increasing recharge and decreasing water application of groundwater during the growing season due to a saturated soil profile. A conservative estimate suggests that 25,000 acres in Big Valley of
2605 agricultural and native vegetation lands are accessible to surface water and available for AgMAR. Priority will be given to low infiltration over very-low infiltration soils for recharge and areas addressing more critical groundwater levels.

9.4 Improved Hydrologic Function and Upland Recharge
9.4.1 Forest Health / Conifer and Juniper Thinning
The watershed surrounding the Big Valley Basin is comprised of approximately 800,000 acres of conifer forest and rangeland (Figure 9-5). Management policies have resulted in tree densities that are currently much higher than at the beginning of the 20th century. This includes western juniper and other mixed conifers (Stephens et al. 2016) (Miller and Tausch 2001). There are two main mechanisms by which dense junipers and other conifers impact water availability in forested watersheds. First is the interception of snow (primarily) and rain that gets caught in branches and needles and evaporates before ever reaching soil surface, and second is the high rate of transpiration due to dense layered canopy and vigorous network of roots (Ryel and Leffler 2011). An excellent summary paper by Smerdon et al. (2009) describes linkages between forest health and tree density and groundwater recharge in a variety of landscapes. Spring snow water content ranged from 33 to 44 percent higher in the aspen and an open meadow snowpack telemetry (SNOTEL70) site versus adjacent juniper and conifer forest, where interception of snowfall was much higher (LaMalfa and Ryel 2008). Averaged over the entire catchment, strategically placed fuel treatments in the wetter central Sierra Nevada (American River) creating a relatively light vegetation decrease (8%), resulted in a 12 percent runoff increase, averaged over wet and dry years. With forest treatments, wildfire reduced vegetation by 38 percent and increased runoff by 55 percent. Without treatments, wildfire reduced vegetation by 50 percent and increased runoff by 67 percent.","Page 9-7 / 9.1.1

9.4.2 Stream Channel Enhancement and Meadow Restoration
Several meadow restoration techniques exist for the purpose of returning proper hydrologic function to montane and rangeland meadows. Two commonly used in the Big Valley Basin and surrounding uplands include pond and plug and beaver dam analogs. Both techniques result in reconnection of a stream channel with a functioning floodplain and restoration of a degraded meadow’s water table up to its historic level. Restoration of the meadow water table results in re-watering of meadow soils and vegetation, with significant effects throughout the restored floodplain for meadow hydrology, wildlife use, and forage. Restored floodplain connectivity spreads flood flows so that a meadow’s natural ability to settle the coarse or fine sediment delivered from steeper stream reaches is restored and natural percolation can occur. When floodplain function is restored, a portion of winter and spring runoff is stored in meadow soils rather than racing down the pre-project gully during the runoff season. Data  indicates that release of this stored runoff results in increased stream flow in late spring. (Hunt et. al. 2018)","Page 9-15 / 9.3.2

A voluntary well monitoring program has been available in Big Valley for upwards of two decades through the Lassen-Modoc Flood Control and Water Conservation District.69 Reinvigorating this program by identifying meters that need to be replaced, conducting outreach to add new wells to the program, and organizing the historical data fills a data gap and provides critical data to refine the water budget and pinpoint areas of concern. Meters are available for agricultural and domestic water users. Funding from DWR in a grant to Modoc County is currently available to provide well meters to voluntary applicants. Further, it would be beneficial to identify additional monitoring wells to provide unobstructed measurements year-round. Several such wells have been installed at five sites within the Basin and generate monthly data across 15-minute intervals. Expanding on this existing program would further refine the water budget. Additionally, funding is available to install satellite transducers in key areas throughout the Basin, which would allow for real-time monitoring of domestic well levels. Coupled with an increased effort to both verify well numbers and update lists to reflect active versus inactive wells, these real-time monitoring locations will provide more accurate estimates of domestic groundwater demand and supply within the Basin. Thus, these combined actions will further inform water management strategies to ensure that domestic users’ groundwater needs are represented equitably in the water budget.

While Big Valley is extremely rural and economically disadvantaged, there are opportunities to enhance water conservation among domestic water users, particularly regarding domestic landscaping, use of native drought adapted plants, irrigation timers, effective mulch, and rainwater/snow water catchments to reduce water requirements. Low-water landscaping can also be integrated with homeowner firesafe planning. Landscaping guides for homeowners can be distributed at public centers and at regional garden supply stores (Hartin et. al. 2014) (California Native Plant Society, 2021).

The GSAs support continued education on preventing illegal dumping, illegal marijuana growers, properly sealing abandoned wells and BMPs. Continued outreach to support the coordination of efforts and information sharing, fostering relationships with relevant agencies and organizations and attending meetings with local and regional groups involved in water management are also important. This includes increasing public outreach about funding opportunities and programs that support water conservation methods, increased recharge and mediation opportunities for decreasing water levels.

As detailed in Section 3.3 – Land and Water Use, water use for illegal activities (i.e., unlicensed marijuana cultivation) occurs in the Basin and surrounding watershed. Lassen and Modoc County staff have limited time and resources to address this issue, but they do actively enforce their local cultivation ordinance (which does not allow for commercial marijuana cultivation) Staff in Lassen County conduct areal patrols and utilize high-resolution aerial imagery from an imaging contractor as part of their effort to identify and abate illegal cultivation. Unfortunately, federal and state agencies responsible for taking enforcement action against illegal marijuana grows in their jurisdictions (e.g., on public lands or when illegally diverting surface water) have not been aggressive in identifying and removing said illegal grows in the Basin and watershed. That said, when county resources are available, staff will continue to work in the field and with their imaging contractors to identify and abate illegal marijuana cultivation on private land.
