Disadvantaged Communities. The City is recognized as a Disadvantaged Community (DAC).5 Meetings will be held in proximity to this area to allow easy access for interested parties. Information about GSP development and meeting dates/times will be posted in areas that the City has found to be successful in reaching underrepresented populations in previous outreach efforts. These areas include public events such as the Farmer’s Market, City kiosks at City facilities such as the finance office where utility bills are paid, the parks and recreation department where after-school programs are coordinated, and other City facilities such as the Senior Citizens Center.

Regular meetings of the Groundwater Sustainability Commission provide an opportunity for City and County staff, participating parties, and their consultants to present updates on the status of GSP development. Meetings are scheduled every three months (quarterly). See the GSP development schedule (Appendix D) for planned dates. An interested party may sign up on the emailing list using the Portal to receive updates on meeting dates and times. Meetings of the Groundwater Sustainability Commission are subject to the Brown Act and are open to the public.

Stakeholder workshops are designed to create opportunities for stakeholders and other interested parties to provide meaningful input during GSP chapter development. The workshop schedule is aligned with the GSP development schedule (Appendix D) for this purpose. The workshops will be led by technical experts such as consultants or GSA staff. Workshop dates will vary based on when input is deemed most useful. Suggestions for optimizing the benefit of the workshops are listed below. • Choose workshop venues, dates, and times to maximize stakeholder participation. •Use the Portal to inform interested parties about workshops during GSP development.

The general process for establishing minimum thresholds and measurable objectives for the SMC and assessing significant and unreasonable conditions constituting undesirable results in the Basin was iterative and included the following: • Evaluating historical data on groundwater elevations from wells monitored by the City and County. • Evaluating water budget information presented in Chapter 6, including sustainable yield estimates and average deficits for the San Luis Valley and Edna Valley parts of the basin. • Holding a series of public outreach meetings that outlined the GSP development process and introduced stakeholders to SMC, MOs, MTs, and other related information. • Soliciting public comment and input on several alternative minimum threshold and measurable options based upon preliminary technical analysis presented at GSC meetings and the five guiding principles agreed upon. • Evaluating public comment to assess what are significant and unreasonable effects relevant to SMC. Public comments from outreach meetings were analyzed to assess if different areas in the Basin had different perspectives for what constitutes an undesirable result in the Basin and how minimum thresholds and measurable objectives are established. • Combining public comment, outreach efforts, hydrogeologic data and considering the interests of beneficial uses and groundwater users, land uses, and property interests in the Basin to describe undesirable results and setting preliminary conceptual MTs and MOs. • Performing groundwater model simulations that incorporate projects and management actions discussed in Chapter 9 to assess if the SMC are achievable. • Conducting public meetings to present recommended preliminary conceptual minimum thresholds and measurable objectives that are technically sound and reasonable, and receiving additional public input. Presentations and discussion of SMCs occurred at eleven meetings in the Basin between March 2020 and May 2021. • Reviewing and considering public and GSC input on recommended preliminary SMCs with GSA

Tribal Governments. Per SGMA §10720.3(c), any federally recognized Indian tribe may voluntarily agree to participate in the planning, financing, and management of groundwater basins. There are no federally recognized Native American tribes within the geographic boundaries of the San Luis Obispo Valley Basin. However, the Northern Chumash Tribal Council community encompasses the County area. Therefore, the San Luis Obispo Valley GSAs will refer to DWR’s Engagement with Tribal Governments Guidance Document and will contact the tribal representative to invite participation in GSP development.

Communications about GSP development will be sent only in digital format. For those who don’t have access online or prefer to receive direct postal mailings, the agenda and agenda packet will be mailed to those who request it. There may be times when a direct postal mailing is appropriate. The County sent a mailer in May 2019 to provide information about the next two Commission meetings. The mailer also includes a request form for the recipient to fill out and return to the County if he/she desires to receive notification of future events via postal mail. A copy of the mailer is provided as Appendix E.

Given previous outreach efforts within City limits, the City does not believe a direct mail piece would be effective in reaching community members or the DAC population. To reach these community members, the City plans to direct outreach efforts for SGMA meetings to online resources, public events such as a Farmer’s Market, and with outreach at several City kiosks at City facilities including the finance office where utility bills are paid, the parks and recreation department where after-school programs are coordinated, and at other City facilities such as the Senior Citizens Center.

Groundwater quality data was evaluated from the SDWIS and GeoTracker GAMA datasets. The data reviewed includes 2,884 sampling events from 403 wells in the Basin, collected between June 1953 and June 2019. Each of the constituents are compared to their drinking waterstandard, if applicable, or their Basin Plan Median Groundwater Quality Objective (RWQCB Objective) (Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast Region, 2017). This GSP focuses only onconstituents that might be impacted by groundwater management activities. The constituentsdiscussed below are chosen because they have either a drinking water standard, a known effect on crops, or concentrations have been observed above either the drinking water standard or the level that affects crops. 
TDS is a constituent of concern in groundwater because it has been detected at concentrations greater than its RWQCB Basin Objective of 900 mg/l in the Basin. The TDS Secondary MCL has been established for color, odor and taste, rather than human health effects. This Secondary MCL includes a recommended standard of 500 mg/L, an upper limit of 1,000 mg/L and a short-term limit of 1,500 mg/l. TDS water quality results ranged from 180 to 3,100 mg/l with an average of 727 mg/l and a median of 613 mg/l. &&&
Nitrate is a constituent of concern in groundwater because it has been detected at concentrations greater than its RWQCB Basin Objectives of 5 mg/l (as N) in the Basin. The Nitrate MCL has been established at 10 mg/l (as N). Overall, nitrate water quality results ranged from below the detection limit to 80 mg/l (as N) with an average of 3.9 mg/l (as N) and a median value of 2.0 mg/l (as N).&&&
Arsenic has a Primary Drinking Water Standard withan MCL of 10 ug/l. Overall, arsenic concentrations ranged from below the detection limit to 28 ug/l, withan average value of 2.5 ug/l and a median value of 2 ug/l.&&&
Boron has been detected at concentrations greater than its RWQCB Basin Objective of 200 micrograms per liter (ug/l). Boron water quality results ranged from non-detect to 2,500 ug/l with an average of 0.16 ug/l and a median value of 0.12.&&&
5.9.3.5. Other Constituents
Other constituents found in exceedance of their respective regulatory standard include arsenic, iron, gross alpha, manganese, selenium, and sulfate. Each of these exceedances occurred in samples from a small number of wells, indicating isolated occurrences of these elevated constituent concentrations rather than widespread occurrences, affecting the entire Basin. Isolated concentrations of arsenic, iron, gross alpha, and sulfate in the Basin have been relatively consistent throughout the period of record. Selenium concentrations have generally declined since 2007. There are not enough data to determine the trend of the elevated manganese concentrations in the Basin. Sustainability projects and management actions implemented as part of this GSP are not anticipated to directly cause concentrations of any of these constituents in groundwater to increase.

In accordance with the SGMA Emergency Regulations §351 (o), “Interconnected surface water refers to surface water that is hydraulically connected at any point by a continuous saturated zone to the underlying aquifer and the overlying surface water is not completely depleted”. The interconnected surface water analysis for the Basin consisted of comparing average springtime water level elevations in wells adjacent to the San Luis Obispo Creek with the elevation of the adjacent San Luis Obispo Creek channel. In cases where average springtime water levels were greater than the elevation of the adjacent San Luis Obispo Creek channel, the stream reach was considered as potentially ‘gaining’. In cases where average springtime water levels were below the adjacent channel elevation, the stream reach was considered ‘losing’ and potentially ‘disconnected’. It is important to recognize that the results of these analyses may reflect conditions that occur occasionally, in response to precipitation events. They may not be representative of long-term average conditions. The analysis outlined above resulted in identification of two areas of San Luis Obispo Creek that occasionally ‘gain’ water from the Alluvial Aquifer; the confluence of Stenner Creek and San Luis Obispo Creek, and the reach of San Luis Obispo Creek downstream from the Wastewater Treatment Plant to the confluence with Prefumo Creek. These are displayed in Figure 5-14. Several reaches of San Luis Obispo Creek are identified that occasionally ‘lose’ water to the Alluvial Aquifer. Groundwater levels in the San Luis Valley part of the Basin are generally high enough that the creek is connected to the underlying aquifer. Along most of Corral de Piedras Creeks, by contrast, surface water levels are generally greater than 30 feet above the groundwater level, and the streams are considered seasonally disconnected from the underlying Alluvial Aquifer in this area. Evaluation of groundwater elevation hydrographs provides additional insight into the character of interconnected surface water in San Luis Valley and Edna Valley. The differences between the surface water regimes of the two subareas of the Basin are discussed below.",Page 5-26 / 5.7 && Figure 5-16,"1. Is there a clear map of ISWs? Yes

These are displayed in Figure 5-14. Several reaches of San Luis Obispo Creek are identified that occasionally ‘lose’ water to the Alluvial Aquifer. Groundwater levels in the San Luis Valley part of the Basin are generally high enough that the creek is connected to the underlying aquifer. Along most of Corral de Piedras Creeks, by contrast, surface water levels are generally greater than 30 feet above the groundwater level, and the streams are considered seasonally disconnected from the underlying Alluvial Aquifer in this area. && Groundwater withdrawals are balanced by a combination of reductions in groundwater storage and changes in the rate of exchange across hydrologic boundaries. In the case of surface water depletion, this rate change could be due to reductions in rates of groundwater discharge to surface water, and increased rates of surface water percolation to groundwater. Seasonal variation in rates of groundwater discharge to surface water or surface water percolation to groundwater occur naturally throughout any given year, as driven by the natural hydrologic cycle. However, they can also be affected by anthropogenic actions. Since, as presented in the discussion of hydrographs in Section 5.7, there have been no long-term water level declines in San Luis Valley, it is therefore concluded that no long-term depletion of interconnected surface water due to groundwater management has occurred in this area. As discussed in the hydrograph analysis of alluvial wells in the Edna Valley, Corral de Piedras Creek appears to be regularly (seasonally) disconnected from the groundwater in the underlying aquifer since the 1950s. Additional monitoring data is proposed in Chapter 7 (Monitoring Network) and Chapter 10 (Implementation Plan), including surveying of channel elevations proximate to nearby well elevation, establishment of additional stream gages, development of rating curves for existing flood stage gages, and other actions",5-26 / 5.7  && Page 5-28 / 5.7.1,"1.

This dataset was reviewed by Stillwater Sciences, and a Technical Memo generated (Stillwater Sciences, 2020) that is included as Appendix F, and the resulting distribution of potential GDEs is shown in Figure 5-17. There has been no verification that the locations shown on this map constitute GDEs. Additional field reconnaissance is necessary to verify the existence and extent of these potential GDEs and may be considered as part of the monitoring effort for future planning efforts. && DWR has compiled a statewide Natural Communities Commonly Associated with Groundwater (NCCAG) database (DWR, 2018). This database identifies potentially groundwater dependent ecosystems based on the best available vegetation and wetland data (Klausmeyer, 2018). DWR identifies potentially groundwater dependent wetland areas using National Wetland Inventory (NWI) wetland data (USFWS, 2018). These data were evaluated and assessed to accurately capture wetland and riverine features. In the Basin, the best available vegetation mapping data set was from the California Fire and Resource Assessment Program Vegetation (FVEG), (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 2015). FVEG is a remotely sensed dataset that classifies vegetation to coarse types (i.e., the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System). Given the limitations of this dataset to accurately capture and identify vegetation using a precise classification system, it was deemed inappropriate for use in determining potential GDEs. Instead, a manual assessment of vegetation with potential groundwater dependence was conducted using National Agricultural Imagery Program 2018 color aerial imagery (NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program), 2018). Vegetation communities identified as potentially groundwater dependent included riparian trees and shrubs, and oak woodlands. Oak woodlands were considered potentially groundwater dependent due to their deep rooting depths (up to 70 feet (Lewis, 1964)). Potential vegetation and wetland GDEs were retained if the underlying depth to water in 2019 was inferred to be 30 feet or shallower based on the existing well network (Figure 5-17). Depth to groundwater was interpolated from seventeen wells for which groundwater level data was available in the spring of 2019 (Figure 5-6). The depth to groundwater estimated in Figure 5-17 is assumed to represent regional groundwater levels; however, the screening depth is known for only 6 of the 17 of the wells. Wells where the screened depth is unknown may be measuring groundwater levels for deeper aquifers that are unconnected to the shallow groundwater system, and thus groundwaterdeeper than 30 ft for a given well may not reflect the absence of shallow groundwater, but instead reflects the absence of data. To determine the hydraulic connectivity between potential perched aquifers to the regional aquifer, additional monitoring with nested piezometers could be utilized. For the purposes of differentiating between potential and unlikely GDE’s, different assumptions were made for the San Luis Valley versus Edna Valley in areas of no groundwater data. In the San Luis Valley, underlying San Luis Obispo Creek, it was assumed that the depth to regional groundwater was less than 30 feet because the limited available data indicate that groundwater in this sub-area is generally relatively shallow. In the Edna Valley (underlying Pismo Creek), it was assumed that the depth to regional groundwater was more than 30 feet because the limited available data indicate that the groundwater in this sub-area is generally deeper; therefore, much of the area of the lower reaches of East and West Corral de Piedras Creeks is unlikely to have GDEs. One exception to this assumption was made on upper East Corral de Piedra, where the conditions were assumed to be similar to those on upper West Corral de Piedra, where wet conditions have been observed to persist into late spring or early summer (Stillwater Sciences, 2014) (Balance Hydrologics, 2008). The 30-foot depth criterion is consistent with guidance provided by The Nature Conservancy (Rohde, 2019) for identifying GDEs.

It is good that the unlikely were mapped, but the plan used sparse groundwater data to include/not include NC dataset polygons.

As discussed in Section 7.2.2, groundwater quality constituents in the Basin that have been selected for groundwater quality indicator monitoring include TDS, Nitrate, and Arsenic. Selenium has been observed at concentrations that affect well operations at individual wells in the Basin, but it does not appear to be a widespread issue throughout the Basin.&&&
The Basin will be considered to have Undesirable Results if, for any 5-year GSP Update period, an increase in groundwater quality minimum threshold exceedances is observed at 20 percent or more of the RMSs in the Basin, as a result of groundwater management implemented as part of the GSP.&&&8.5.1.1. Criteria for Establishing Undesirable Results (§354.26(b)(2))
Significant and unreasonable Chronic Lowering of Groundwater Levels in the Basin are those that:
• Reduce the ability of existing domestic wells of average depth to produce adequate water for domestic purposes (drought resilience).
• Cause significant financial burden to those who rely on the groundwater basin.
• Interfere with other SGMA Sustainability Indicators.
8.5.1.2. Possible Causes for Undesirable Results (§354.26(b)(1)) Conditions that could theoretically lead to an undesirable result include the following: • Continuation of current levels of Edna Valley groundwater pumping without development of additional water supply projects, or development of additional municipal or agricultural pumping at significantly higher rates than are currently practiced. Maintenance of current or additional non-de minimis pumping may result in continued decline in groundwater elevations and exceedance of the proxy minimum threshold. • Expansion of de minimis pumping. Adding domestic de minimis pumpers in the areas of the Basin administered by the County may result in lower groundwater elevations, and an exceedance of the proxy minimum threshold. • Extensive, unanticipated drought. Minimum thresholds are established based on reasonable anticipated future climatic conditions. Extensive, unanticipated droughts more severe than those on record may lead to excessively low groundwater recharge and unanticipated high pumping rates that could cause an exceedance of the proxy minimum threshold.
8.8.1.1. Criteria for Establishing Undesirable Results §354.26(b)(2)
Criteria used to establish the Undesirable Results for Degraded Water Quality Sustainability
Indicator are observed water quality data and trends that: • Reduce capacity of public water supply systems or unreasonably increase costs for public or private water supply. • Reduce crop production. • Result in constituent concentrations above regulatory primary drinking water standards at supply wells.• Results in constituent concentrations above the RWQCB Basin Objectives for secondary standards (TDS)
8.8.1.2
Conditions that may lead to an undesirable result include the following:
• Changes to Basin Pumping: If the location and rates of groundwater pumping change as a result of projects implemented under the GSP, these changes could cause movement of one of the constituents of concern towards a supply well at concentrations that exceed relevant water quality standards.
• Groundwater Recharge: Active recharge with imported water or captured runoff could cause movement of one of the constituents of concern towards a supply well in concentrations that exceed relevant water quality standards. • Recharge of Poor-Quality Water: Recharging the Basin with water that exceeds a primary or secondary MCL or concentration that reduces crop production could lead to an undesirable result. However, permitting requirements generally preclude this circumstance.
8.8.1.3. Effects of Undesirable Results on Beneficial Users and Land Uses §354.26(b)(3)
As defined in this GSP, undesirable results are established to prevent degradation of water quality within the Basin prior to the implementation of any actions inherent in the management of groundwater in the Basin. This limits the potential impacts of undesirable water quality on beneficial users in the Basin.However, potential effects of undesirable results include:
• Increased water treatment costs for public or private supply wells
• Reduced agricultural production

The groundwater elevation MTs effectively limit the amount of groundwater pumping in the Basin. However, the MTs for the RMSs in the San Luis Valley are established below currently observed
groundwater elevations to allow for reasonable future development of groundwater for potable supply to City residents. If groundwater elevations experience significant and sustained decline in the immediate
vicinity of SLO Creek, this could potentially result in less groundwater discharge to the creek due to areas of interconnected groundwater and surface water. Impacts to stream flows will be monitored with
the augmentation of current data collection programs in San Luis Valley, and the addition of new stream gauges in the Basin.
Domestic land uses and users
The groundwater elevation MTs are established to protect as many domestic wells as possible.
Therefore, the MTs will likely have an overall beneficial effect on existing domestic land uses by
protecting the ability to pump from domestic wells within the Edna Valley portion of the Basin. However,
limited saturated thickness in some localized areas in the Basin of the shallowest domestic wells may
require owners to drill deeper wells if water levels are decreased. Additionally, the groundwater
elevation MTs may limit the increase of non-de minimis groundwater use in order to limit future declines
in groundwater levels caused by non-de minimis domestic pumping.
&&&Urban Land Uses and Users
The degraded groundwater quality minimum thresholds generally benefit the urban water users in the Basin. Limiting the number of additional wells where constituents of concern could exceed primary or secondary MCLs ensures an adequate supply of quality groundwater for municipal use. Management of the Basin to prevent occurrences of these MTs may also result in lowered costs for water treatment. Existing State, Federal, Public Health or Municipal regulations may require that a well not be used if MCLs are exceeded and may supersede any actions related to SGMA-related MT exceedances. Wells in violation of federal, state, and local water quality regulations will have to comply with the specific regulations.

Groundwater elevation MTs protect the groundwater resource and the existing ecological habitats that rely upon it because they are set to avoid significant and unreasonable declines in groundwater levels. As noted above, groundwater level MTs may limit increases in non-de minimis and agricultural groundwater uses. Ecological land uses and users may benefit by this reduction in non-de minimis and agricultural groundwater uses. $$$$
Ecological Land Uses and Users
Although the groundwater quality minimum thresholds do not directly benefit ecological uses, it can be
inferred that the degraded groundwater quality minimum thresholds generally benefit the ecological
water uses in the Basin. Preventing constituents of concern from migrating will prevent unwanted contaminants from impacting ecological groundwater supply.
$$$The MT for Depletion of Interconnected Surface Water is defined to maintain historically observed groundwater elevations.
The practical effect of this GSP for protecting against the Depletion of Interconnected Surface Water MTs is that it encourages minimal long-term net change in groundwater elevations in the vicinity of the Basin streams. Seasonal and drought cycle variations are expected, but during average conditions and over the long-term, beneficial users will have access to adequate volumes of water from the aquifer to service the needs of all water use sectors. The beneficial users of groundwater are protected from undesirable results.
 Ecological Land Uses and Users
Groundwater dependent ecosystems would generally benefit from this MT. Maintaining groundwater levels close to within historically observed ranges will continue to support groundwater dependent ecosystems. More detailed mapping of GDEs, installation of gages in Edna Valley, and development of discharge rating curves for the San Luis Creek gages, all will clarify the effects of these MTs on ecological uses.","Page 8-18/ 8.5.2.4

Additional field reconnaissance is necessary to verify the existence and extent of these potential GDEs and may be considered as part of the monitoring effort for future planning efforts. && The wells in Table 7-6 used for monitoring of ISW that may support GDEs need to be in locations that are representative of groundwater levels in the riparian zones. A few of the existing wells (SLV-5, SLV-19, EV-11) are not immediately adjacent to their paired stream gage but may have a sufficient hydraulic connection to local riparian conditions to be useful for GDE indicator evaluation. The data for each paired monitoring well and stream gage would be supplemented with field surveys (discussed below), to evaluate the suitability of the monitoring sites. In addition to streamflow and groundwater level monitoring, streamflow surveys are recommended across a range of seasons and water year types to identify losing and gaining reaches with the Basin. Identifying losing and gaining reaches is fundamental to understanding surface water-groundwater connectivity. Losing reaches occur in Basin recharge areas that are typically dry during the summer and late fall. Gaining reaches occur in Basin discharge areas where groundwater is contributing to surface water flow. Groundwater pumping that lowers groundwater levels in an aquifer beneath a creek channel may deplete surface water by either expanding a losing reach or contracting a gaining reach, depending on the depth of the water table and the permeability of the stream bed. The streamflow surveys characterize the extent of gaining and losing reaches and help evaluate depletion of interconnected streamflow. This type of data collection is conducted by measuring instream flow in multiple locations along a reach of creek in a short period of time and examining the loss or gain of stream flow rates along the length of the stream channel.",Page 5-29 / 5.8,"1.

State Water Project Recharge Basin
To enhance recharge in the Edna Valley, a groundwater recharge basin could be constructed to percolate SWP water. A groundwater recharge basin is a bermed basin structure designed for the
purpose of efficiently allowing water collected in the basin to infiltrate through the ground surface, percolate through the vadose zone, and ultimately recharge the underlying aquifer. The concept of this
project is to construct a recharge basin in the Edna Valley and supply it with water obtained from the SWP to recharge the aquifer.
The conceptual location selected for this project is near the southeast corner of Biddle Ranch Road and State Highway 227 (aka, Edna Road, Figure 9-3). This area is classified as having high recharge
potential in the Stillwater Percolation zone Study discussed in Chapter 4 (Basin Setting). This land is currently utilized for agriculture, and it is assumed that a parcel of land adequate to build the recharge
basin could be purchased. Water would be conveyed via a 6,000 foot 6-inch pipeline from the SWP pipeline, along Biddle Ranch Rd, to a newly constructed recharge basin on approximately 5 acres of
land along Orcutt Road. 
9.4.3.1. Project Benefits (§ 354.44.5)
In order to assess this project’s benefits to the aquifer and effect on sustainability of the Basin in terms of expected water levels, Project Scenario 2 was simulated using the integrated GSFLOW model
developed as part of the GSP effort. The project was defined to represent 500 AFY of supplemental water provided from the SWP made available to a newly constructed recharge basin to be located in
Edna Valley. Benefits of recharge basins versus direct delivery to offset pumping include the potential to deliver water during seasonal periods when there is less demand for SWP water supplies and
capacity in the SWP conveyance systems.
A baseline simulation was performed as previously described. The recharge basin is assumed to be less than 500 feet by 500 feet in area and is simulated in a single cell in the model. Recharge is input
as a flux in MODFLOW (feet/day), so a flux rate equivalent to 500 AFY percolating into a 500 ft by 500 ft cell was input into model cell on a constant basis. The project was defined as beginning in 2026,
allowing five years for project design and implementation.
Figure 9-3 displays the baseline and Project Scenario 2 hydrographs for this project for the four Edna
Valley wells identified as RMS for the Chronic Lowering of Groundwater Levels Sustainability Indicator.
Data indicate that the increase in water levels over the baseline scenario in year 2042 at these wells
ranges from 2 feet at EV-16 to 52 feet at EV-04, which is the closest RMS to the recharge basin
location. The water level increase in the SWP recharge basin scenario over baseline was 21 feet at EV-
09, and 4 feet at EV-13. These results are summarized in Table 9-6.",Page 9-16 / 9.4.3.1,"1. Are there projects that involve groundwater recharge? Yes

State Water Project for Agricultural Irrigation
The Coastal Branch of the SWP conveys water from the California Aqueduct to San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties (Figure 9-1). The California Aqueduct is operated by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The Coastal Branch provides water to two SWP Contractors: the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (via the Central Coast Water Authority
(CCWA), a Joint Powers Authority) and the SLOCFCWCD. The CCWA owns, operates, and maintains the Polonio Pass Water Treatment Plant (PPWTP) and operates the portion of the Coastal Branch that
is downstream of Polonio Pass.
The Coastal Branch transects the Edna Valley subarea and runs along Orcutt Road as shown in Figure 9-1. This project includes the construction of a new turnout to the Coastal Branch along Orcutt Rd south
of the Energy Dissipation Valve and 200 feet of 10-inch pipeline to connect to the existing Edna Valley Growers Mutual Water Company distribution system. The project would allow for approximately 1,000
AFY of SWP water based on the availability and cost of SWP water and will offset an equivalent amount of the irrigation demands currently met by groundwater. The SWP water is a treated water
supply and may require dechlorination before being used for agricultural purposes. SWP water for irrigation use to offset pumping could be purchased from 1) District subcontractors that
receive their SWP water through Lopez and Chorro Valley Participants, 2) Santa Barbara County Participants or 3) a portion of the SLOCFCWCD's unsubscribed Table A amount (14,463 AFY). Any
necessary agreements/terms would need to be identified, negotiated and developed amongst relevant parties, and environmental review would need to be conducted, to facilitate the transfers. The recent
adoption of the Water Management Tools Amendment to the SWP Contracts by the SLOCFCWCD and the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (SBCWCFCD) presents new
opportunities for obtaining SWP water supply and delivery capacity to Edna Valley.///  Investigating the use of SWP as a supplemental water source would occur within the first year of
implementation. Following the recommendations of the feasibility study, negotiations to acquire SWP from the identified sellers could take up to 5 years. The design and construction of the turnout and

Estimates for historical pumping were derived from various sources, including purveyor records, land use data and water duty factors, and daily soil-moisture budgets. The total estimated groundwater production in the SLO Basin during the water budget period of 2016 to 2019 was approximately 6,000 AFY. Of the 6,000 AFY, only about 5% or 300 AFY is metered. Groundwater purveyor meter records were provided by the City of San Luis Obispo, Golden State Water Company, Edna Ranch MWC, and Varian Ranch MWC. A groundwater extraction metering and reporting plan is a foundational component of the GSP that will facilitate the reporting of groundwater extraction data and the development of a groundwater accounting framework. The collection and reporting of this data will enable the GSAs to adaptively manage the groundwater resources. The location and quantity of agricultural pumping was identified as a significant data gap during the development of the water budget and integrated model. The collection of metered groundwater pumping data will provide a key metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the demand management strategies that will be included in the Demand Management Plan. The Groundwater Extraction Metering and Reporting Plan will include a de minimis self-certification and non de minimis extraction and reporting program. ",9-35 / 9.5.2,,

The City’s goal is to use this water source to the highest and most beneficial use. The City is committed to the expansion of its non-potable recycled water programs and to the development of a potable reuse program to supplement groundwater and/or surface water supplies. The delivery of the City’s recycled water to parties within the Edna Valley area has been identified as a potential short-term augmentation project to offset further lowering of groundwater levels within the Edna Valley. With current in-City recycled water demands and influent into the WRRF, it is anticipated that the City could provide 500-700 acre-feet of recycled water annually with quantities decreasing as new in-City users come online, as indoor water conservation is increased as a result of statewide water efficiency mandates, and as the City develops potable reuse projects to supplement its water supplies. In-City groundwater basin augmentation efforts, new regulations, drought, additional in-City customers, and the like could reduce the quantity available to outside users by several hundred acre-feet per year in the foreseeable future. The project includes the construction of 2,600 feet of 8-inch pipeline, a pumpstation, and a turnout to connect to the existing Edna Valley Growers Mutual Water Company distribution system. The project would allow for the delivery of approximately 100 AF/Month in the winter months with minimal amounts available during summer months and would replace some of the agricultural irrigation demands currently met by groundwater.
