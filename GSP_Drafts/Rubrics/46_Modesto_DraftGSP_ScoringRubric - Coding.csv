","Disadvantaged Communit*, DAC, stakeholder, beneficial user",Yes,"4.2.10. Disadvantaged Communities (§10723.2(i)) Data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018 show six Census Designated Places within the Modesto Subbasin that meet the annual Median Household Income (MHI) criteria to be considered a disadvantaged community or severely disadvantaged community by the State: Airport, Empire, Oakdale, Rouse, Waterford, and West Modesto. These communities are identified in Figure 4-1. The MHI for each is identified in Table 4-2 below.

These communities are represented on the Committee and TAC by the City of Modesto, City of Oakdale, City of Waterford, and Stanislaus County. Water users in these communities were notified about development of the GSP through bilingual (English-Spanish) water bill inserts; notices and information distributed through the GSA member agencies’ existing communication platforms (e.g. websites, social media accounts, newsletters); and presentations provided at community advisory councils and other organizations. The STRGBA GSA distributed a bilingual electronic survey in Spring and Summer 2019 to assess stakeholders’ understanding and perspectives on key SGMA topics and gather input on preferred outreach strategies. The survey was promoted via utility bill inserts, postings on the STRGBA GSA and GSA member agencies’ websites and social media pages, and a notice in the Stanislaus County Farm Bureau’s Farm News. The survey went out to all water service customers, which included the communities of West Modesto, Rouse, Airport, Empire, and the City of Modesto. The survey results were posted on the STRGBA GSA website and used to develop the Modesto Subbasin Communication and Engagement Plan. City of Modesto staff, on behalf of the STRGBA GSA, also attended various community meetings to discuss proposed locations for new groundwater monitoring wells and inform community members about development of the GSP. This included presentations at the Airport Neighborhood Collaborative, West Modesto Community Collaborative, and Empire Municipal Advisory Council in August and September 2019. In addition, informational materials were distributed through Stanislaus County Municipal Advisory Councils. Groundwater users in communities designated as disadvantaged also had the opportunity to participate in development of the GSP through monthly Committee and TAC meetings and public workshops.

4.4.1. STRGBA Committee and Technical Advisory Committee Meetings Monthly STRGBA GSA Committee and TAC meetings served as key opportunities for beneficial users and interested parties to track the process and consult in development of the GSP. Both meetings are held and noticed in accordance with the Brown Act and are open for members of the public to listen and provide comments. Comments on items on the agenda may be provided after GSA discussion on the item. There is also time set aside for members of the public to provide comment on items not on the agenda. Public comments are recorded in the meeting minutes, which are posted on the STRGBA GSA website. Comments were recorded and considered by the planning team when developing and revising the GSP chapters. The meetings were initially held in-person at MID’s office at 1231 11th Street, Modesto, CA 95354 and by teleconferencing. In April 2020, the meetings were shifted to a virtual platform due to social distancing requirements and temporary changes in Brown Act requirements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Members of the public were able to provide comment at the meetings via calling into the meeting or submitting comments in the virtual meeting platforms. The GSAs noticed the meetings via a posting on the STRGBA GSA website and email distributed to the Interested Parties Database. A notice was also posted at the MID office for in-person meetings. Meeting agendas and materials were distributed to the Interested Parties Database and posted on the STRGBA GSA website prior to each meeting.

4.4.2. Public Workshops and GSP Office Hours The GSAs held a public workshop and several Office Hours to inform beneficial users and interested parties about the GSP development process and collect input on topics central to the development of the GSP and groundwater management practices. The GSAs hosted a public workshop in June 2020 focused on SGMA and GSP development process. The GSAs also hosted three Office Hours in March 2021, May 2021, and August 2021. The workshop topics included the draft sustainable management criteria, groundwater monitoring network, and management areas. The Office Hours are less formal than regular workshops and provide members of the public an opportunity to have a dialogue with STRGBA GSA representatives outside of the monthly meetings. All workshops and Office Hours scheduled after April 2020 were held virtually due to local and state social distancing requirements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions and comments submitted by members of the public was recorded by the planning and outreach staff. A summary of feedback provided by workshop participants was provided at GSP Coordination Committee and Technical Committee meetings and recorded in the workshop summaries, provided in Appendix D. Recordings of the May and August 2021 Office Hours were also made available on the STRGBA GSA website.

The Modesto Subbasin GSAs’ boundaries include three census-designated places considered disadvantaged by the state: Empire, Airport, and West Modesto. These communities are also identified in DWR’s DAC Mapping Tool. The MHI for each is identified in Table 3 below. All three of these communities are located within and receive water from the City of Modesto. Therefore, they will be represented by the City of Modesto during the groundwater sustainability planning process.

Individuals living in communities state-designated disadvantaged face unique challenges when it comes to participating in public planning processes. This may include physical and/or linguistic barriers which may impede their ability to provide input on plans or regulations that impact them. The Modesto Subbasin GSAs intend to use best practices to help address barriers these communities may face in participating in the GSP development and implementation processes. These may include translating materials and fliers into multiple languages, offering interpreting services at public workshops and meetings, holding workshops and meetings at familiar and trusted locations (e.g., schools, community centers, churches), and ensuring workshops/meetings are held at times accessible by a wide range of people. (Note that due to social-distancing and local health ordinances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the subbasin’s outreach activities are being adapted to virtual engagement formats.) The Modesto Subbasin GSAs may also partner with local community advocates or organizations to educate community members about SGMA and to encourage involvement in public events. Often leveraging the communication channels of these trusted messengers is a more effective means of reaching DACs than traditional communication methods.","4-7 to 4-8

These considerations may range from monitoring activities to steps to preserve and expand these natural resources. Stewardship of these resources has primarily been led through a combination of regulatory and nonprofit organizations. In the Subbasin, the Tuolumne River Trust—an advocacy group representing the Tuolumne River—is actively involved in water-management planning activities. Other organizations may include The Nature Conservancy, Stanislaus Audubon Society Chapter, and others. These organizations represent sources of valuable input on the subject matter of groundwater-dependent ecosystems that are being considered during GSP development. The Modesto Subbasin GSAs may engage leadership from these groups throughout the groundwater sustainability planning process for discussion of environmental water needs and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. These meetings may include participation from other watershed stewardship organizations in the Subbasin. In addition, interested stewardship organizations may also request briefings with the Modesto Subbasin GSAs and participate in the outreach activities described in Section 4.3, above.

Constituents of Concern
A list of potential constituents of concern was developed by the technical team based on a preliminary data review, and review of previous water quality analyses developed in the Subbasin. The constituent list was reviewed at two public STRGBA GSA TAC meetings – April and July 2019. Based on input from TAC members, nine potential constituents of concern were identified for the analysis as listed below: The following is a summary of groundwater quality conditions in the Modesto Subbasin during historical (water year 1995 to 2014) and present (2015 to 2019) periods, emphasizing these potential constituents of concern (COCs). Based on a review of water quality and input from the TAC, these COCs are the most likely to affect groundwater quality from irrigated agriculture (i.e., nitrate, TDS, and DBCP), which is the dominant land use across the Modesto Subbasin, from other human point sources (i.e., PCE) and from natural geogenic sources (i.e., arsenic, boron, uranium, and Gross Alpha) in the Subbasin. Nitrate is reported here as nitrate (as N); nitrate values reported in the original data sources as nitrate (as NO3 -) were converted to nitrate (as N) prior to analysis.
Nitrate
Point sources of nitrate in groundwater include feedlot and dairy drainage, leaching from septic systems, wastewater percolation, industrial wastewater, aerospace activities, and
food processing waters (Viers et al., 2012). Denitrification is the only natural process that attenuates nitrate concentrations in groundwater. Previous studies have shown that
denitrification is promoted in groundwater with anoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen (DO) < 0.5 mg/L) and large amounts of organic carbon (Gurdak and Qi, 2012). However, there are too few measurements of DO (N = 29) in the database to evaluate if oxic or anoxic conditions exist and the potential for denitrification. All of the DO samples except for two have concentrations in the oxic range (>0.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L)), which indicates a limited potential for denitrification. Future groundwater quality monitoring that includes measurements of DO could help characterize the potential for denitrification and explain the vulnerability of groundwater in the Modesto Subbasin to nitrate contamination. Nitrate in groundwater from municipal wells in the Modesto Subbasin has been detected in concentrations that approach and, in some cases, exceed the MCL for drinking water (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019). Currently, six municipal wells in the City of Modesto have been taken off-line due to elevated nitrate concentrations (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019). Blending of water is being used to reduce nitrate concentrations at other municipal wells. Nitrate is present in the City of Modesto’s drinking water aquifers because of historical agricultural and wastewater management activities. Nitrate is often detected in the shallow aquifer system, but in some cases, can be drawn down into the deeper aquifer by pumping or through wells with long screened or perforated intervals (Jurgens et al., 2008). Nitrate migration is influenced by downward hydraulic gradients created by municipal pumping, and elevated nitrate concentrations are being drawn deeper in the aquifer near local cones of depression (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019). A total of 41,898 groundwater samples in the Modesto Subbasin have nitrate analyses and an average concentration of 5.3 mg/L (as N) and generally meet drinking water quality standards (Table 3-3). The median value (5.0 mg/L) is approximately double of the range of nitrate concentrations (2 to 3 mg/L) that have been established by previous studies as representing relative background concentrations from natural processes (Gurdak and Qi, 2012). Although isotopic analysis on the nitrate are needed to identify the source, the median value of 5.0 mg/L indicates that more than half of the samples are above the relative background concentration and thus have a nitrogen input from mostly human sources, such as fertilizers. The majority (93%) of the nitrate analyses have concentrations that are below the MCL of 10 mg/L (as N) (Table 3-3). However, 7% of the nitrate samples have concentrations that exceed the MCL (Table 3-3). The average and maximum concentrations of nitrate in groundwater from wells in the Modesto Subbasin during the period of water year 1995 to 2019 are shown in Figures 3-3 and 3-36. Nitrate concentrations are illustrated as green circles (less than 5 mg/L), yellow circles (between 5 mg/L and the MCL of 10 mg/L), orange circles (between 10 and 15 mg/L), and red circles (greater than 15 mg/L). Wells with average nitrate concentrations below the MCL of 10 mg/L (as N) tend to be located within the central part of the Subbasin, especially within the urban areas surrounding Modesto, Oakdale, Riverbank, and Waterford (Figure 3- 35). The wells that have average nitrate concentrations that exceed the MCL of 10 mg/L (as N) are mostly located within the agricultural lands to the west and east of Modesto, but there are also clusters of exceedances within the City of Modesto (Figure 3-35). The spatial pattern of maximum nitrate concentrations is similar to the spatial pattern of average nitrate concentrations; most wells with maximum nitrate concentrations below the MCL tend to be in urban areas and the maximum nitrate concentrations above the MCL tend to be in the agricultural lands (Figure 3-36). However, there are several wells in Modesto and other urban areas of the Subbasin that have maximum nitrate concentrations above the MCL. The spatial patterns in the average and maximum nitrate concentrations are apparently influenced by the general land-use pattern of the Subbasin. Summary statistics of nitrate concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. The average nitrate concentrations are similar (5.6, 5.9, and 5.8 mg/L) in the Eastern, Western Upper, and Western Lower Principal Aquifers. The percentage of samples that exceed the 10 mg/L MCL in the Western Upper (13%) and Western Lower (22%) is greater than in the Eastern Principal Aquifer (3%). The data indicate that groundwater quality is relatively similar above and below the Corcoran Clay.
Total Dissolved Solids
Total dissolved solids (TDS) represents the total concentration of anions and cations in water and is a useful indicator of mineralization, salt content, and overall groundwater quality. The TDS concentrations in groundwater of the Modesto Subbasin generally meet drinking water quality standards (Table 3-3) and some irrigation requirements. A total of 16,288
groundwater samples in the Modesto Subbasin have TDS analyses and only 14% of those samples exceed the California Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) of 1,000
mg/L (Table 3-3). TDS can also be used to characterize the salinity of irrigation water, which can affect crop health and yield (Grattan, 2002). It is recommended that TDS concentrations should be below about 450 mg/L for irrigation of salt sensitive crops, and TDS concentrations between about 450 and 1,000 mg/L can represent a salinity hazard for plants if used as irrigation water (Bauder et al., 2014). About half (49%) of the samples have TDS concentrations less than 450 mg/L and would not cause plant stress. However, 36% of samples are between 450 and 1,000 mg/L and 14% of samples are greater than 1,000 mg/L. Therefore, about 51% of groundwater samples have TDS concentrations that could result in plant stress and salinity hazard as irrigation water. To identify any areas of concern, the median and maximum TDS concentrations in groundwater from wells within the Modesto Subbasin during the period of water year 1995 to 2019 are shown in Figures 3-37 and 3-38. TDS concentrations are illustrated as green circles (below 500 mg/L), yellow circles (between 500 and 1,000 mg/L), orange circles (between 1,000 and 1,500 mg/L), and red circles (above 1,500 mg/L). The median and maximum TDS concentrations in groundwater throughout most of the Modesto are below 1,000 mg/L (Figures 3-37 and 3-38). Concentrations of TDS are generally lowest (less than 500 mg/L) in the central part of the Subbasin, especially within the urban areas surrounding Modesto, Oakdale, Riverbank, and Waterford (Figure 3-37 and 3-38). Concentrations of TDS above the MCL are generally found in wells located in the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge on the western extent of the Subbasin, in southwest Modesto, and to the southeast of Modesto (Figure 3-37 and 3-38). Summary statistics of TDS concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. The average TDS concentrations are similar (389 and 192 mg/L) in the Eastern and Western Lower Principal Aquifers. However, the average TDS in the Western Upper Principal Aquifer (733 mg/L) is much higher than in the other two Principal Aquifers. Similarly, 13% of TDS samples from the Western Upper Principal Aquifer exceed the MCL, while only 1 and 0% of the samples from the Eastern and Western Lower exceed the MCL. These results, along with the 20,000 mg/L maximum concentration may indicate a point source affecting TDS concentrations in the Western Upper Principal Aquifer (Table 3- 5).
Arsenic
Groundwater arsenic concentrations in the Subbasin are generally higher in older and deeper groundwater samples (Jurgens et al., 2009). Arsenic in groundwater from municipal
wells has been detected in concentrations that approach and, in some cases, exceed the MCL for drinking water (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019). Several municipal wells from the City of Modesto have been taken off-line due to elevated arsenic concentrations (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019). The concentrations of arsenic are generally low in groundwater of the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL (Table 3-3). A total of 5,993 groundwater samples have arsenic analyses and only 7% of those analyses exceed the California MCL of 10 μg/L (Table 3-3). The wells with average concentrations of arsenic that exceed the MCL are generally located in the urban area of Modesto and in wells on the western extent of the Subbasin (Figures 3- 39). Wells with maximum concentrations of arsenic that exceed the MCL are also generally located in the urban areas of Modesto and Riverbank, and wells on the western extent of the Subbasin (Figure 3-40). Summary statistics of arsenic concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. The average arsenic concentrations in the Western Upper (9.5 μg/L) and Western Lower (8.3 μg/L) Principal Aquifers are more than double the 3.1 μg/L average concentration in the Eastern Principal Aquifer. Similarly, 17% of the arsenic samples in both the Western Upper and Western Lower exceed the MCL, as compared to only 3% of samples in the Eastern Principal Aquifer. These data indicate important differences may exist in the source(s) and geochemical conditions that control arsenic in groundwater of the Western Upper and Lower Principal Aquifers as compared to the Eastern Principal Aquifer.
Uranium
Uranium has been detected in municipal wells at concentrations that approach and, in some cases, exceed the MCL for drinking water (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019).
Currently, nine municipal wells in the City of Modesto have been taken off-line due to elevated uranium concentrations (JJ&A and Formation Environmental, 2019). The concentrations of uranium are generally low in groundwater across much of the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL (Table 3-3). A total of 3,326 groundwater samples have uranium analyses and 8% of those analyses exceed the California MCL of 20 pCi/L (Table 3-3). Most of the uranium samples were collected from supply wells within the urban areas of Modesto, Oakdale, Riverbank, and Waterford. The wells with average (Figure 3-41) and maximum (Figure 3-42) uranium concentrations that exceed the MCL tend to be located in the City of Modesto. Summary statistics of uranium concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. The uranium concentrations in groundwater are much greater in the Western Upper Principal Aquifer, as compared to the Eastern or Western Lower Principal Aquifers. A total of 20% of uranium samples in the Western Upper exceed the MCL, while only 5 and 0% in the Eastern and Western Lower, respectively, exceed the MCL. These differences in uranium concentration among groundwater of the Principal Aquifers are consistent with the processes of the oxic and bicarbonate rich irrigation return flow that mobilizes uranium in the shallow and intermediate aquifer.
Gross Alpha
The concentrations of gross alpha are relatively low in groundwater across much of the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL (Table 3-3). A total of 1,369 groundwater
samples have gross alpha analyses and 85% of those analyses have concentrations that are less than the California MCL of 15 pCi/L. A total of 15% of the groundwater samples exceed the gross alpha MCL, which is a higher percentage than uranium samples exceeding the MCL (Table 3-3). Similar to the uranium samples, most of the gross alpha samples were collected from supply wells within the urban areas of Modesto, Oakdale, Riverbank, and Waterford. The wells with average (Figure 3-43) and maximum (Figure 3-44) uranium concentrations that exceed the MCL tend to be located in the City of Modesto, especially in the southwest part of Modesto. Summary statistics of gross alpha in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. Similar to the pattern of uranium, the gross alpha in groundwater is much greater in the Western Upper Principal Aquifer, as compared to the Eastern or Western Lower Principal Aquifers. A total of 20% of uranium samples in the Western Upper exceed the MCL, while only 5 and 0% in the Eastern and Western Lower, respectively, exceed the MCL. Similar to uranium, these differences in gross alpha among groundwater of the Principal Aquifers are consistent with the processes of the oxic and bicarbonate rich irrigation return flow that mobilizes uranium in the shallow and intermediate aquifer.
Boron
contaminants widely distributed in the U.S. and associated with granitic rock, including the Sierra Nevada. The California MCL for gross alpha in drinking water is 15 pCi/L. The concentrations of gross alpha are relatively low in groundwater across much of the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL (Table 3-3). A total of 1,369 groundwater samples have gross alpha analyses and 85% of those analyses have concentrations that are less than the California MCL of 15 pCi/L. A total of 15% of the groundwater samples exceed the gross alpha MCL, which is a higher percentage than uranium samples exceeding the MCL (Table 3-3). Similar to the uranium samples, most of the gross alpha samples were collected from supply wells within the urban areas of Modesto, Oakdale, Riverbank, and Waterford. The wells with average (Figure 3-43) and maximum (Figure 3-44) uranium concentrations that exceed the MCL tend to be located in the City of Modesto, especially in the southwest part of Modesto. Summary statistics of gross alpha in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. Similar to the pattern of uranium, the gross alpha in groundwater is much greater in the Western Upper Principal Aquifer, as compared to the Eastern or Western Lower Principal Aquifers. A total of 20% of uranium samples in the Western Upper exceed the MCL, while only 5 and 0% in the Eastern and Western Lower, respectively, exceed the MCL. Similar to uranium, these differences in gross alpha among groundwater of the Principal Aquifers are consistent with the processes of the oxic and bicarbonate rich irrigation return flow that mobilizes uranium in the shallow and intermediate aquifer.
Pesticides
Pesticides in groundwater can result from the over-application on agricultural lands or from point-source contamination and preferential flow down improperly constructed wells. While pesticides are typically soluble in water, many can be highly sorptive to soils, which can slow their transport to the water table. The analysis is focused on the two widely detected pesticides Dibromochloropropane (DBCP) and 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP).
Dibromochloropropane (DBCP)
The concentrations of DBCP are generally low in groundwater of the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL (Table 3-3). A total of 9,636 groundwater samples have DBCP analyses and 86% of those analyses and below the California MCL of 0.2 μg/L (Table 3-3). The remaining 14% of samples with DBCP concentrations above the MCL are from wells that are generally located to the north, west, and southeast of the City of Modesto (Figures 3-47 and 3-48). Summary statistics of DBCP concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. The percentage of DBCP samples that exceed the MCL are somewhat similar (15 and 23%) in the Eastern and Western Upper and greater than in the Western Lower (0%) Principal Aquifer. Unlike nitrate concentrations that were somewhat similar above and below the Corcoran Clay, relatively higher concentrations of DBCP appears to be more frequently detected in only the Western Upper Principal Aquifer. The relatively longer flow paths and travel times for groundwater below the Corcoran Clay may help to limit DBCP concentrations in the Western Lower Principal Aquifer.
1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP)
The concentrations of TCP in groundwater in the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL are shown in Table 3-3. A total of 5,004 groundwater samples have TCP analyses and
4% of those analyses are above the California MCL of 0.005 μg/L (Table 3-3). The wells with average (Figures 3-49) and maximum (Figures 3-50) TCP concentrations that exceed the MCL are located primarily in the urban areas of Modesto, Riverbank and Waterford. As discussed below in the section on historical and present trends, the wells with elevated TCP tend to have concentrations that are sometimes two to three orders of magnitude greater than the MCL. Such high concentrations of TCP may indicate locations of point-source contamination. Summary statistics of TCP concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer, Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. TCP exceedances of the MCL occur in 15% of Eastern Principal Aquifer samples, 23% of Western Upper Principal Aquifer samples, and 0% of Western Lower Principal Aquifer samples. These data suggest that relatively lower concentrations of TCP are below the Corcoran Clay.
Tetrachloroethylene (PCE)
The concentrations of PCE are generally low in groundwater in the Modesto Subbasin as compared to the MCL (Table 3-3). A total of 8,262 groundwater samples have PCE analyses and 92% of those analyses are below the California MCL of 5 μg/L (Table 3-3). Most PCE concentrations above the MCL are from wells located in Modesto and Oakdale, which are likely impacted by historical dry-cleaning operations (Figures 3-51 and 3-52). Summary statistics of PCE concentrations in groundwater from the Eastern Principal Aquifer,
Western Upper Principal Aquifer, and Western Lower Principal Aquifer are shown in Tables 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6, respectively. The percentage of PCE samples that exceed the MCL are
somewhat similar (9% and 7%) in the Eastern and Western Upper and greater than in the Western Lower (0%) Principal Aquifer. Similar to patterns in DBCP and TCP concentrations, relatively lower concentrations of PCE appear to be detected below the Corcoran Clay in the Western Lower Principal Aquifer. The low permeability of the clay associated with relatively longer flow paths and travel times for groundwater below the Corcoran Clay may help to limit PCE concentrations in the Western Lower Principal Aquifer.

Figure 5-48 demonstrates that in 2070 with climate change added, in low precipitation months, there is approximately equal probability that the month will be wetter or drier than projected conditions baseline. However, under climate change, the 2070 conditions will be wetter in months with precipitation above approximately 50 mm, indicated by the vertical gray dashed line. Therefore, under climate change conditions (in the scenario selected for the GSP), we can see that the occurrence of low precipitation months will likely not change significantly, but the higher precipitation months are predicted to be wetter overall than the projected conditions baseline.","Page 5-54 / 5.2.6.3.1

Therefore, the tool to process ET provided by DWR was not needed or used. Change factors provided by DWR for November 1, 1964 through December 1, 2011 were averaged. This average ET change factor was then applied to the baseline ET time series for each crop type. Because the same ET change factor was applied over the entire baseline, no synthesis was required in this analysis. Refinement to the simulated evapotranspiration of orchards under 2070 climate conditions is shown in Figure 5-49 below as an example. For 2070, the average change factor is 1.08.","Page 5-57 / 5.2.6.3.2

Due to the uncertainty in CalSim II-simulated reservoir operations, flows from CalSim II provided by the state are not used directly in the Modesto GSP climate change analysis.

An undesirable result will occur when at least 33% of representative monitoring wells exceed the MT for a principal aquifer in 3 consecutive Fall monitoring events.
6.3.1.1. Causes of Undesirable Results – Adverse Impacts to Wells
The combination of over-pumping and drought caused widespread adverse impacts to Subbasin water supply wells during drought conditions WY 2014 – WY 2017, resulting in undesirable results. Even though well owners appear to have mitigated most of these impacts, GSAs intend to arrest water level declines so that future widespread impacts to water supply wells can be avoided. Adverse impacts to water supply wells caused by chronic lowering of groundwater levels are discussed below. In general, lower water levels increase pumping costs. If water levels fall below the pump intake, costs may be incurred for pump lowering and/or other well modifications. Further declines can result in water levels falling below the top of well screens, potentially decreasing capacity or well integrity due to geochemical changes, biological clogging, and/or air entrainment. Water level declines can also damage wellbore equipment, such as pumps or casing, from cavitation or other mechanisms. If water levels fall below the bottom of the well and do not sufficiently recover, the well is dewatered and would require replacement. Older wells, shallow wells, and/or wells with casing integrity issues typically have a higher risk of failure. In the Modesto Subbasin, the GSA member agencies responsible for public drinking water supplies documented numerous adverse impacts to public supply wells caused by declining water levels during drought (WY 2014 to WY 2017). During that period, declining water levels provided an opportunity to observe impacts associated with the historic low levels throughout much of the Subbasin. Most agencies observed a decrease in capacity and well efficiency. Some drinking water wells failed due to collapsed casing or other problems. More than 150 domestic wells were also adversely impacted (locations on Figure 6-1). As indicated in Table 6-2, not all beneficial users of groundwater wells in the Modesto Subbasin experienced adverse impacts during the 2014 to 2017 drought. During this period, the cities of Riverbank and Oakdale were able to operate their deep drinking water supply wells without interruption. Similarly, Modesto ID did not experience well problems. The City of Modesto did not experience well impacts directly related to the drought but had water quality problems that could be exacerbated if groundwater levels continue to decline in the Subbasin. In the western Subbasin, groundwater levels experienced relatively small declines (less than 10 feet) and recovered quickly after 2016.Most well impacts in Table 6-2 occurred in the central-eastern Subbasin due to the presence of numerous water supply wells in areas of more significant water level declines (Figure 6-1; see also hydrographs on Figure 3-25). Although the 159 reported domestic well failures occurred throughout the Subbasin, most failures were concentrated in the eastern half of the Subbasin (Figure 6-1). Although most of these domestic wells appear to have been replaced, areas with vulnerable domestic wells have been identified along the Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers (dashed areas on Figure 6-1). The City of Waterford is located within the vulnerable area along the Tuolumne River, where one of its primary water supply wells required replacing and lowering of a well pump during the 2015 drought (Table 6-2). Near the vulnerable area along the Stanislaus River, Oakdale ID reported water level declines of 20 feet to 50 feet from 2005 to 2020 in its deep water supply wells. Since 2016, water levels have continued to decline about 1.3 feet per year in the main service area and 2 to 4 feet per year in eastern OID. These declines caused adverse impacts to Oakdale ID deep agency wells. In addition, many landowners complained to Oakdale ID regarding private well issues. Finally, the outreach team noted impacts to a few private wells as reported on the Modesto Subbasin Stakeholder Survey (see Chapter 4). Out of 12 responses from well owners, two reported either capacity or water quality issues with their well; the remaining 10 responders did not report well issues during the 2014-2017 drought.
&&&
6.3.1.2. Potential Effects on Beneficial Uses
Adverse impacts described above affect all beneficial uses of groundwater accessed through wells including municipal, domestic, industrial, and agricultural water supply. Any of these impacts can also affect property interests. For agricultural users, impacts can increase costs, delay irrigation operations, and result in damage to crops. For industrial users, well issues can affect operational costs, delay goods and services, or adversely affect industrial processes relying on a specific groundwater quality. For public water suppliers, well impacts can increase wellfield operational costs, reduce pressure in distribution systems, cause water quality concerns, or even jeopardize the ability to provide a reliable and safe drinking water supply. Impacted domestic well owners during the 2014-2017 drought reported the need for trucked water, use of temporary or permanent storage tanks, purchase of bottled water, lowering of well pumps, drilling of replacement wells, and other measures . A valley-wide shortage of drillers caused significant delay in the ability to lower a pump or otherwise modify/replace a well. In addition, domestic well owners in the Modesto Subbasin are often without financial resources necessary to replace their household water supply. Many domestic wells are located in underrepresented and economically-disadvantaged communities where wells are the only available drinking water source. Although this sustainability indicator is focused on adverse impacts to wells, chronic lowering of groundwater levels can also adversely impact environmental uses of groundwater, including GDEs (Section 3.2.8). Given that GDEs in the Modesto Subbasin are primarily located along the three river boundaries, GDE impacts are also affected by the interconnected surface water sustainability indicator, as discussed in Section 6.8. Many of these adverse well impacts that occurred during the 2014-2017 drought appear to have been mitigated. Public water suppliers have secured groundwater supply from new or modified wells. Proposed GSP projects will increase surface water deliveries for municipal supply in both Waterford and Modesto (see Chapter 8). Most of the failed domestic wells appear to have been replaced. DWR well completion records indicate that about 236 new domestic wells have been drilled since 2015 – about 1.5 times the number of previously-reported failed wells. Although data are insufficient to provide a one-to-one match, most new wells are near the estimated location of a failed well and appear to be replacement wells5. Since 2016, only three domestic wells have been reported as being impacted from lower water levels. These domestic wells were reported to be dry as of August and September 2021 as indicated on the DWR Household Water Supply Shortage Reporting System (Household Water Supply Shortage Reporting System (ca.gov)). Of those three wells, the two in the City of Modesto were shallow wells with total depths of 29 feet and 79 feet. The reported failed well in the City of Oakdale had a total depth of 149 feet.
&&&
6.6.1.1. Causes of Undesirable Results
In the Modesto Subbasin, public water suppliers have noted some deterioration in water quality during recent drought conditions, especially constituents of concern arsenic and TDS;
these observations suggest that concentrations of these constituents may be elevated at depth. The City of Modesto has conducted numerous investigations of water quality issues
in their wellfields and notes that correlations between constituent and depth are complex. Degraded water quality can impair groundwater supplies, causing restrictions and/or costs
for operation of drinking water supply wells. Increasing costs to provide a reliable and safe drinking water supply could lead to undesirable results. Costs and impacts for domestic
wells are also a concern because those wells often represent the sole water supply for the household. Impacts to other beneficial uses other than drinking water supply could also lead
to undesirable results. Certain constituents can harm crops, limit water supply for certain industrial processes, harm pipes, cause accelerated corrosion or clogging of fixtures, cause
staining on bathtubs and sinks, produce bad taste or odor, and cause acute or chronic health effects. In the Modesto Subbasin, seven constituents of concern have been identified as having the most likely potential for causing undesirable results based on widespread exceedances of MCLs and adverse impacts on public water suppliers in the Subbasin. Those constituents have been of most concern to GSA member agencies as documented in a July 2019 public workshop on Subbasin water quality. The constituents of concern are associated with a variety of sources including both naturally-occurring (geogenic) conditions and human related (anthropogenic) activities. The naturally-occurring constituents of concern may be elevated at certain depths or in certain aquifer layers and may be of most use in tracking impacts from GSA management of groundwater levels. The anthropogenic constituents of concern, including nitrate, 1,2,3-TCP and PCE (and some sources of TDS), are likely sourced at or near the ground surface where human-related activities occur. This suggests that shallow aquifers are more often impacted from these constituents. However, pumping can cause downward migration of these constituents into deeper aquifers either through more permeable portions of an aquitard or in conduits such as wells.
&&&
6.6.1.2. Potential Effects on Beneficial Uses
As summarized above, degraded water quality can impair water supply and create considerable operational costs or constraints on public water suppliers. Public water suppliers may need to inactivate or abandon impacted wells, re-distribute wellfield pumping, blend contaminants with clean wells or surface water, drill additional wells, install wellhead or regional treatment facilities, and/or make other operational changes. Immediate notifications to customers may also be required. If constituents of concern impact domestic wells, residents may lose their water supply; if water quality is not well known in domestic wells, impacts to public health and safety could occur. Agricultural and industrial uses of groundwater could also be adversely impacted as summarized in the previous section. Finally, environmental beneficial uses of groundwater could be impacted; for example, if pumping caused the migration of high salinity groundwater into freshwater areas, GDEs could be affected. For the Modesto Subbasin, six of the seven constituents of concern have primary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) that are associated with health concerns such as toxicity (i.e., nitrate, uranium) or carcinogens (i.e., arsenic, 1,2,3-TCP, DBCP, and PCE). Accordingly, elevated concentrations of these constituents in drinking water can cause deleterious health effects. Wellhead treatment has been installed on numerous drinking water supply wells to manage these constituents. In particular, the City of Modesto has removed numerous water supply wells from service over time to manage local water quality issues (as indicated by the water quality icon on Figure 6-1). Constituents with concentrations above the health-based MCLs significantly affect operations and costs for public water suppliers to ensure a safe drinking water supply.
&&&
An Undesirable Result is defined as significant and unreasonable adverse impacts to groundwater quality as indicated by a new (first-time) exceedance of, or further exceedance from, an MCL for a constituent of concern that is caused by GSA projects, management actions, or management of groundwater levels or extractions such that beneficial uses are affected and well owners experience an increase in operational costs. An undesirable result will occur when a Subbasin potable water supply well in the defined monitoring network reports a new (first-time) exceedance of an MT or an increase in concentration above the MT for a Modesto Subbasin constituent of concern that results in increased operational costs and is caused by GSA management activities as listed above.","Table 6-3

&&&
6.8.1.1. Causes of Undesirable Results
In the Modesto Subbasin, groundwater extractions – primarily in the NDE MA – have lowered groundwater levels locally and in adjacent areas to the west. These extractions intercept groundwater that would have naturally flowed toward the river boundaries, depleting some amount of baseflow to the rivers. This streamflow depletion increases over time during the historical study period (note the declining amounts of stream/aquife interaction as groundwater outflow, as shown in blue on Figure 5-20). Modeling of projected future conditions suggests that the area of groundwater level declines will expand to the north and south toward the Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers and cause increases in streamflow depletion (compare the net river gains/losses between historical and projected conditions in Table 5-8). Groundwater extractions in other parts of the Subbasin also contribute to this depletion, especially along the rivers. In the projected conditions scenario, both the Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers transition from net gaining streams to net losing streams, a continuation of a trend that began in recent years. If depletion increased significantly more than indicated from the modeling, the groundwater system could become disconnected from the surface water system. At that point, groundwater would no longer contribute baseflow to the river. Lower groundwater levels would induce more recharge from the river, significantly depleting flows; these conditions would produce an undesirable result. In the Modesto Subbasin, integrated surface water-groundwater modeling indicates that the groundwater system and river system remain connected through the 50-year implementation and planning horizon under future projected conditions. This indicates that even if future water levels declined to the extent estimated, connection between the two systems could be maintained. The projected streamflow depletions average about 26,000 AFY, only about one percent of the total river outflows from the Subbasin. Nonetheless, these future projected increases in streamflow depletion result in a net loss of streamflow from the river systems compared to a net gain in streamflow over historical conditions. In addition, beneficial uses could be adversely impacted at these predicted levels of streamflow depletion even if the groundwater and surface water systems remain connected (see Section 6.8.1.2 below). Accordingly, the projections for future streamflow depletions are considered undesirable results in this GSP.
&&&
6.8.1.2. Potential Effects on Beneficial Uses
Beneficial uses of the three Modesto Subbasin rivers are provided in the Basin Plan for the Sacramento River Basin and the San Joaquin River Basin (CVRWQCB, 2018). All three rivers are associated with almost all categories of beneficial uses including municipal (including potential uses), agricultural, and/or industrial supply; recreation; freshwater habitat,
migration, and spawning; and wildlife habitat. The three rivers also support large riparian corridors. A preliminary evaluation of vegetative and wetland areas mapped by TNC as
natural communities commonly associated with groundwater (NCCAG) indicates potential GDEs along most of the river reaches in the Modesto Subbasin (DWR, 2018) (see Section
3.2.8, revisions in progress). Although predicted future streamflow over the 50-year baseline conditions are not precise, the predicted depletions result in lower streamflow during low flow conditions. These changes could exacerbate drought conditions on the rivers and adversely affect all beneficial uses that rely on surface water. Both Modesto ID and Oakdale ID noted that more water would have to be released over time to meet current downstream flow requirements. This would make operation of the river more difficult, especially during low-flow conditions, and provide less water supply for municipal and agricultural beneficial uses during times when water demands are high. In addition to adverse impacts to surface water rights holders, these conditions could also adversely impact flows needed to support fish and other wildlife. The large riparian corridors along the river could be adversely impacted. Lower groundwater levels adjacent to the rivers could impact GDEs and other environmental uses of groundwater that occur along the Subbasin river boundaries.
&&&
An Undesirable Result is defined as significant and unreasonable adverse impacts to the beneficial uses of surface water caused by groundwater extraction. An undesirable result will occur on either the Tuolumne or Stanislaus rivers when 33% of representative monitoring wells for that river exceed the MT in three consecutive Fall monitoring events. An undesirable result will occur on the San Joaquin River when 50% of representative monitoring wells for that river exceed the MT in three consecutive Fall monitoring events.

Justification and Support for Minimum Thresholds
GSP regulations require that MTs for this indicator be supported by: • The rate of groundwater elevation decline based on historical trends, water year type, and projected water use in the basin. • Potential effects on other sustainability indicators. (§354.28 (c)(1)(A)(B)). Historical declines in groundwater levels across the Subbasin are discussed throughout Section 3.2 and specifically in Section 3.2.2; associated water year types are based on the detailed information in Section 4.2.2.1 (also see Figure 3-2). Figures 3-21 through 3-25 present hydrographs showing rates of decline in selected wells with relatively long water level records across the Subbasin. Figure 6-1 provides locations of failed domestic wells from 2014 to 2017, representing undesirable results caused by groundwater level declines (also discussed in Section 2.3.2 and shown on Figure 2-15). Figure 2-x (in progress) shows the location of new and/or replacement domestic wells drilled since the 2015 drought.
&&&
For most western wells, the MT was typically defined by 2015-2016 water levels. Even if water levels continue to decline in the eastern Subbasin while the GSP is being implemented, projects and management actions will have to be sufficient for water levels to recover back to the selected MT. The following conditions were considered when setting the MT at the historic low groundwater elevation: • Replacement wells and other well improvements appear to have mitigated impacts from low water levels during the 2015-2016 drought conditions. • The large number of new and deeper domestic wells drilled since 2015 can reasonably be assumed to accommodate current low water levels, with some tolerance for future droughts. • The Subbasin is not currently experiencing widespread adverse impacts to water supply wells that occurred in 2015-2016 and formed the basis for its undesirable result definition. • Most of the MTs are commensurate with recent Fall 2020 water levels; no additional undesirable results were identified during that Fall period. • As of Spring 2021, groundwater levels are within about 10 feet of the MT; several wells are below the MT.
&&&
6.3.2.4. Effects of MTs on Beneficial Uses and Users of Groundwater
By arresting groundwater level declines in the Subbasin, long-term use of groundwater will become more sustainable and provide benefits to all beneficial uses of groundwater in the Subbasin. However, there are consequences to maintaining these MTs for some current beneficial uses of groundwater. In brief, the current level of groundwater use will not be able to be sustained without sufficient projects or management actions to replenish the Subbasin. This will require maintenance of water levels in deep wells that could otherwise accommodate additional declines. In the NDE MA, where growers are currently reliant on groundwater for agricultural beneficial uses, significant investment in projects and supplemental water will be required to support the current level of agricultural production. If projects cannot meet the sustainable yield, demand reduction will need to be considered, which could negatively affect property interests in the Subbasin. Conversely, the beneficial uses of public water suppliers and domestic well owners will be supported by the MTs. Although water levels will be allowed to decline somewhat during drought conditions, the Subbasin will not be subject to the continual historic lows that would occur with deeper MTs. With improved long-term maintenance of water levels, municipal water suppliers will avoid the loss of expensive public drinking water supply wells as has been documented in public meetings (e.g., by the City of Waterford). The need for widespread domestic well replacements can also be avoided (see Table 6-1).
&&&
Based on these analyses seven constituents of concern were selected for assignment of an MT and further characterization on an annual basis based on elevated concentrations over a relatively widespread area of the Subbasin. These constituents have been the most difficult to manage according to public water suppliers. The constituents also include a variety of sources and occurrences across the Subbasin to provide a more comprehensive tracking of groundwater quality. Specifically, the constituents include: • naturally-occurring constituents (arsenic, uranium, TDS) • special constituents with widespread areas of multiple non-point sources (nitrate, 1,2,3-TCP, DBCP) • constituents associated with industrial point sources and environmental investigations (PCE).
Data were evaluated for all three principal aquifers in the Subbasin because all are used for drinking water supply. The City of Modesto is the largest drinking water supplier and has wells in all three principal aquifers. The cities of Riverbank, Oakdale, and Waterford have municipal supply wells in the Eastern Principal Aquifer (see Figure 2-13). In addition to these providers, more than 75 smaller water systems scattered throughout the Subbasin also have wells in each of the principal aquifers. Numerous domestic wells also occur in both western and eastern principal aquifers. However, very few wells or drinking water systems are
located in the eastern third of the Subbasin, (i.e., generally east of Waterford and Oakdale. See Figures 2-10, 2-13, 2-14, and 6-1).

.6.2.1.1. Nitrate
Nitrate is the most widespread constituent of concern in both the California Central Valley and the Modesto Subbasin (see Section 3.2.5). Because of its serious health effects, the MCL of 10 mg/L of nitrate as N is selected as the MT. Sources, median and maximum concentrations, and occurrence of nitrate in Modesto Subbasin groundwater are described in Section 3.2.5.3 and shown on Figures 3-35 and 3-36. Elevated nitrate concentrations are detected in all principal aquifers, including the confined Western Lower Principal Aquife below the Corcoran Clay. Nitrate concentrations have exhibited a slightly increasing trend over the 25-year study period. The widespread occurrence of nitrogen in California’s Central Valley is being regulated by the Central Valley RWQCB under several programs (in addition to individual site regulatory orders). Those programs include the General Dairy Order (Dairy Order), the ILRP, and CVSALTS. Nitrate concentrations in domestic wells are being mitigated through the Nitrate Control Program, which involves management areas with mandates to provide safe drinking water to impacted well owners (Section 2.4.4).
&&&
6.6.2.4. Effects of MTs on Beneficial Uses and Users of Groundwater 
The setting of MCLs as the MTs is protective with respect to the avoidance of undesirable results. By protecting drinking water quality, the long-term quality and quantity of useable groundwater for all beneficial uses will be preserved. The City of Modesto has been historically impacted by water quality problems in their wellfields. About 18 water supply wells had to be removed from service for impacts related to arsenic, nitrate, or uranium (see Section 3.2.5.3). Another 9 water supply wells have been taken offline due to 1,2,3-TCP or PCE contamination. To address these issues, the City has conducted numerous water quality studies and is currently completing a wellfield investigation and feasibility study to identify remedial options for wellfield management. Those independent studies and Subbasin-wide annual tracking of groundwater quality will each inform the other, providing a better understanding of degraded water quality in the Subbasin. The commitment to analyze a large groundwater quality dataset across the Subbasin on an annual basis will improve GSA understanding of water quality in each Principal Aquifer and lead to better management practices. Expanded and ongoing data collection and analysis will also support ongoing regulatory monitoring, allowing others to evaluate their local water quality monitoring data in the context of Subbasin-wide water quality. For example, an improved understanding of water quality with depth allows future wells to be sited and designed such that water quality is optimized. Overall, these improvements will support all beneficial uses of groundwater in the Subbasin.

Based on these analyses seven constituents of concern were selected for assignment of an MT and further characterization on an annual basis based on elevated concentrations over a relatively widespread area of the Subbasin. These constituents have been the most difficult to manage according to public water suppliers. The constituents also include a variety of sources and occurrences across the Subbasin to provide a more comprehensive tracking of groundwater quality. Specifically, the constituents include: • naturally-occurring constituents (arsenic, uranium, TDS) • special constituents with widespread areas of multiple non-point sources (nitrate, 1,2,3-TCP, DBCP) • constituents associated with industrial point sources and environmental investigations (PCE). Data were evaluated for all three principal aquifers in the Subbasin because all are used for drinking water supply.
&&&
Minimum Thresholds are defined as the low groundwater elevation observed in Fall 2015 at each representative monitoring location.
&&&
6.8.2.1. Justification and Support for Minimum Thresholds
GSP regulations require that the MTs be supported by: • Location, quantity, and timing of depletions of interconnected surface water • A description of the groundwater and surface water model used to quantify surface water depletion (§354.28(c)(6)(A)(B)). Background information for the interconnected surface water analysis is provided in Section 3.2.7, (revisions in progress) followed by a preliminary analysis of potential GDEs, which occur along the river boundaries (Section 3.2.8 and Figure 3.60). The historical, projected, and sustainable yield water budgets provide a detailed assessment of groundwater-surface water interaction and are presented in Chapter 5. As described above in Section 6.8.2, the sustainable yield analysis in Section 5.3 was used to support the selection of MTs for this
indicator. These collective analyses are summarized below. In brief, the Tuolumne, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin rivers are interconnected surface water
as defined by SGMA. The surface water-groundwater interaction is dynamic, with recharge and baseflow varying along segments of the river both seasonally and over time. This dynamic system of mixed gaining and losing segments along the Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers is the result of both natural interactions and managed operations. As mentioned previously, both rivers are actively managed to provide critical water supplies for the Modesto, Turlock, and Eastern San Joaquin subbasins. The San Joaquin River has less variability and has the largest flows of the three Subbasin rivers. The segment of the San Joaquin River along the western Modesto Subbasin can be characterized as a net gaining reach during both historical and projected future conditions. The location, quantity, and timing of deletions of these interconnected rivers were analyzed using the integrated surface water-groundwater model C2VSimTM. This local model is based
on the DWR regional C2VSimFG-BETA2 model, which has been revised to include local water budget data for both the Turlock and Modesto subbasins in order to simulate the river boundary more accurately. Local surface water and groundwater data from the Eastern San Joaquin Subbasin to the north was also incorporated into the modeling analyses. These revisions provided increased ability and accuracy for modeling interconnected surface water across the northern and southern river boundaries. Documentation of the revised C2VSim- TM model is provided in Appendix X of this GSP. Interconnected surface water was analyzed with C2VSimTM for historical, current, and future projected water budget conditions including separate average annual water budgets
for the Modesto Subbasin surface water systems (see Table 5-2). Total surface water inflows into the Subbasin historically have averaged about 2,547,000 AFY11 for all three river systems, with about one-half consisting of the San Joaquin River flows. Surface water outflows are estimated at 2,770,000 AFY under historical conditions as measured at the confluence of the Stanislaus River and the San Joaquin River at the northwest corner of the Modesto Subbasin (Table 5-2).
During historical conditions, all three rivers were net gaining on an average annual basis with baseflow contributions of about 61,000 AFY (see the net of the Modesto Subbasin total gains from groundwater (baseflow) and losses to groundwater (seepage/recharge) under historical conditions in Table 5-2). Under future conditions, streamflow seepage is projected to increase in all three rivers, resulting in net depletions on both the Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers over the 50-year period of analysis. Smaller streamflow depletions are projected to occur along the San Joaquin River, but the river remains a net gaining stream overall. Historical conditions represent an average over a 25-year period. During that time, streamflow depletions increased along each of the Subbasin rivers as groundwater extractions increased, especially after about 2005. Figure 5-20 illustrates this increase by showing overall smaller groundwater outflows to the surface water system from WY 2005 to WY 2015 (see annual estimates represented by the stream/aquifer interaction shaded blue on Figure 5-20). Figure 5-25 shows the relatively small amount of total streamflow that is affected by the groundwater system. To reduce the potential for projected future depletions to cause undesirable results, groundwater level declines associated with groundwater extractions need to be arrested. By managing groundwater at or above 2015 groundwater levels, sustainable yield modeling predicts significant improvements in the future projections. A summary of these improvements is shown in the following table. *”Increase in baseflow” refers to the larger contributions to surface water from groundwater (i.e., lower amounts of streamflow depletion) under Sustainable Yield Conditions. As shown in the table above, net streamflow depletion in the Modesto Subbasin rivers is estimated at 26,000 AFY under the projected future baseline conditions. Under sustainable yield conditions, which incorporated the 2015 groundwater elevation MTs, the projected future streamflow depletion is eliminated, and the overall surface water system returns to a net gaining condition. Sustainable yield conditions indicate an increase of 41,000 AFY of baseflow over projected future conditions. Additional details of these data are provided in Section 5.1.4.4 for projected conditions (see also Table 5-2 and Figure 5-24); additional details on the sustainable yield analysis are provided in Section 5.3 (see Table 5-15 and Figure 5-24).
&&&
6.8.2.4. Effects of MTs on Beneficial Uses and Users of Groundwater
The setting of MTs is protective with respect to the avoidance of undesirable results related to streamflow depletion. By arresting groundwater level declines along the river boundaries, the net future projected streamflow depletions can be substantially reduced or eliminated at each of the Modesto Subbasin rivers, and long-term use of groundwater can become more sustainable. Environmental uses of surface water and groundwater would also be supported.","Page 6-23 / 6.3.2.4

This project continues the water purchase agreement between Modesto Irrigation District (MID) and the City of Modesto to meet urban demands. It utilizes the expansion from Phase II of the Modesto Regional Water Treatment Plant (MRWTP). The Modesto Irrigation District operates the MRWTP to treat surface water for use within the City and has been expanding its capacity to meet growing and future water demands from its customers. The Initial Phase (first phase) of the MRWTP Project included the construction of a 30 million-gallon per day (mgd) surface water treatment plant, two 5-million-gallon (MG) terminal storage tanks and associated pumping facility. The pump station delivered water into the MID transmission system for distribution into either the Del Este or City water distribution systems through several MID turnouts. The City now owns the De Este water system. Figure 1-1shows the existing transmission mains and turnouts constructed as part of the Phase One MRWTP Project The Expansion Phase of the MRWTP project (second phase) included the construction of a new parallel treatment process consisting of low-pressure membranes, ozone disinfection system, a dissolved air flotation thickener and a new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The total capacity available at the MRWTP with the completion of the MRWTP Phase Two Expansion project is 60 MGD with a maximum annual supply of up to 67,200 AFY.

8.2.1.1.4 Expected Benefits
Benefits to Sustainability Indicators Utilization of purchased water for urban water demands is expected to offset groundwater pumping demands, with in-lieu groundwater recharge benefits to the Subbasin. The sustainability indicators expected to benefit from this Project are groundwater levels, groundwater storage, interconnected surface water, and possibly land subsidence. All benefits to sustainability indicators in the Modesto Subbasin will be evaluated through groundwater monitoring at nearby monitoring sites, identified in the GSP.
Benefits to Disadvantaged Communities
Water supplied through this project directly benefits areas within the City of Modesto’s contiguous water service areas within the Modesto Subbasin, most of which is classified as a DAC. By supplementing and diversifying their drinking water supply, this Project will provide an alternate drinking water source and operational flexibility to remove or blend production wells with treated surface water to comply with safe drinking water regulations and meeting Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). The additional surface water supply will also reduce groundwater pumping and increase groundwater levels near the communities which can reduce pumping costs and potentially mitigate some groundwater quality concerns. Additionally, benefits to groundwater conditions in the Modesto Subbasin are also expected to broadly benefit all DACs, SDACs, and EDAs in the Modesto Subbasin.

The projects use low impact development (LID) techniques including bio-retention planters, infiltration trenches, and underground retention basins under city parks to recharge the groundwater aquifer. Other benefits include reduced stormwater flows to the City of Modesto’s wastewater treatment plant, reduced number of sanitary sewer overflows, reduction of localized
flooding in heavily traveled and localized streets, and improved water quality for Dry Creek and Lower Tuolumne River (both of which are 303d water bodies). Each project component is located within the City of Modesto jurisdiction in areas with no positive storm drainage systems. The project components are a cost effective and LID alternative to constructing detention basins in undeveloped portions of the city and constructing miles of storm drains. This project also includes the removal of failed dry wells and storm to sanitary sewer cross connections. The Project components, status, and expected recharge benefits are included.

Benefits to Disadvantaged Communities
The City of Modesto storm drain cross connection removal project is expected to provide direct recharge in and around the City of Modesto. Most communities in the Modesto Subbasin are classified as DACs, SDACs, or EDAs (according to 2018 census data, evaluated by place, tract, and block group). Depending on which specific parcels receive surface water deliveries, this Project may directly benefit specific DACs in this area. In addition, maintenance or improvement of groundwater levels will help to protect beneficial groundwater use by rural domestic wells from potential adverse impacts related to chronic groundwater level decline. Benefits to groundwater conditions in the Modesto Subbasin are also expected to broadly benefit all DACs, SDACs, and EDAs.

8.4.2.1.1 Management Action Description
As required in SGMA regulations, groundwater extraction has been calculated by the GSA for this GSP using the groundwater model (Appendix X). Currently, the GSA intends to continue with its current data collection and groundwater extraction monitoring techniques. This management action is provided as an alternative to allow the GSA flexibility and additional options in the event more or alternative forms of data are needed in the future. There are several ways that this management action could be implemented by the GSA. For this plan, two potential components have been developed and include a voluntary program and a comprehensive
program. However, these to potential components are provided only as options. If this management action is initiated, the GSA will further develop options before implementing. · Voluntary program - This program is intended to provide an annual reporting of groundwater use by agricultural and private well owners and surface water transfers for in-lieu use. The Data Management System will be set up with appropriate input data forms for voluntary reporting of groundwater use as well as other relevant information, such as irrigated acreage, crop type, and sources of water. · Comprehensive program - This program is a more robust and elaborate strategy for reporting groundwater extraction that is intended to cover all groundwater users and surface water transfers for in-lieu use. Implementation of this program can be using satellite imagery to estimate the evapotranspiration of crops by parcel. Additionally, this strategy can take the form of requiring the installation of meters at all agricultural wells The Groundwater Extraction Reporting Program would exclude de minimis extractors but may also include surface water accounting in the Subbasin due to the amount of surface water transferred from MID and OID to the non-districted east area used for in-lieu and direct recharge.",Page 8-58 / 8.4.2.1,"1.

8.2.1.1.1 Project Description
This project continues the water purchase agreement between Modesto Irrigation District (MID) and the City of Modesto to meet urban demands. It utilizes the expansion from Phase II of the Modesto Regional Water Treatment Plant (MRWTP). The Modesto Irrigation District operates the MRWTP to treat surface water for use within the City and has been expanding its capacity to meet growing and future water demands from its customers. The Initial Phase (first phase) of the MRWTP Project included the construction of a 30 million-gallon per day (mgd) surface water treatment plant, two 5-million-gallon (MG) terminal storage tanks and associated pumping facility. The pump station delivered water into the MID transmission system for distribution into either the Del Este or City water distribution systems through several MID turnouts. The City now owns the De Este water system. Figure 1-1shows the existing transmission mains and turnouts constructed as part of the Phase One MRWTP Project The Expansion Phase of the MRWTP project (second phase) included the construction of a new parallel treatment process consisting of low-pressure membranes, ozone disinfection system, a dissolved air flotation thickener and a new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The total capacity available at the MRWTP with the completion of the MRWTP Phase Two Expansion project is 60 MGD with a maximum annual supply of up to 67,200 AFY.

8.2.1.1.4 Expected Benefits
Benefits to Sustainability Indicators Utilization of purchased water for urban water demands is expected to offset groundwater pumping demands, with in-lieu groundwater recharge benefits to the Subbasin. The sustainability indicators expected to benefit from this Project are groundwater levels, groundwater storage, interconnected surface water, and possibly land subsidence. All benefits to sustainability indicators in the Modesto Subbasin will be evaluated through groundwater monitoring at nearby monitoring sites, identified in the GSP.
Benefits to Disadvantaged Communities
Water supplied through this project directly benefits areas within the City of Modesto’s contiguous water service areas within the Modesto Subbasin, most of which is classified as a DAC. By supplementing and diversifying their drinking water supply, this Project will provide an alternate drinking water source and operational flexibility to remove or blend production wells with treated surface water to comply with safe drinking water regulations and meeting Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). The additional surface water supply will also reduce groundwater pumping and increase groundwater levels near the communities which can reduce pumping costs and potentially mitigate some groundwater quality concerns. Additionally, benefits to groundwater conditions in the Modesto Subbasin are also expected to broadly benefit all DACs, SDACs, and EDAs in the Modesto Subbasin.","Page 8-12 / 8.2.1.1

The Waterford/Hickman Surface Water Pump Station and Storage Tank (Project) entails connecting the City of Waterford (Waterford) and Hickman to Modesto Irrigation District’s (MID) surface water supply. The Project includes several components, described in order of the flow of the surface water. Surface water will be diverted from MID’s distribution network at a pipeline turn-out located at the corner of Tim Bell and Vineyard Road, northeast of the Waterford. The surface water will be piped into a one-milliongallon storage tank that will be constructed at this intersection. A pump station at this location and transmission line will also be constructed that transports the water to Yosemite Boulevard in Waterford. As part of a separate project, the Waterford and Hickman systems are in the process of being connected and should be completed by the end of 2023. Once the two water systems are connected and the surface water conveyance, storage, and pump station are complete, then Hickman, located in the Subbasin, can utilize surface water from MID through existing transmission lines.
